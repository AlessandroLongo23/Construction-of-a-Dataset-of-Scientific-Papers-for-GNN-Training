We use the recent BESIII measurements of Σ^+→ p γ and Σ^+→ Nπ to reduce the uncertainty in the longdistance contribution to Σ^+→ pμ^+μ^. Beyond the standard model, we consider a general effective Hamiltonian at low energy with ten operators whose Wilson coefficients parametrize the new physics. We derive expressions for the Σ^+→ pμ^+μ^ rate and the associated muon forwardbackward asymmetry in terms of these coefficients.

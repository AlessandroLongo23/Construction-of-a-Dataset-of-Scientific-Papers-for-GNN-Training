This paper explores an AI/ML-based receiver design for PUCCH Format 0. Format 0 signaling encodes the UCI content within the phase of a known base waveform and even supports multiplexing of up to 12 users within the same time-frequency resources. Our first-of-a-kind neural network classifier, which we term UCINet0, is capable of predicting when no user is transmitting on the PUCCH, as well as decoding the UCI content of any number of multiplexed users, up to 12. Inference results with both simulated and hardware-captured field datasets show that the UCINet0 model outperforms conventional DFT-based decoders across all SNR ranges.  "

It encodes the UCI within phase rotations applied to a pre-defined base sequence. This paper presents a Machine Learning based decoder for Format 0 that uses a Neural Network (NN) to predict the phase rotation. This paper, an extension of our previous work~\\cite{yerrapragada2023machine}, is one of the first attempts at designing such a receiver for 5G PUCCH Format 0.      \\item PUCCH Format 0 signals can be transmitted either by individual UEs or by multiple UEs (a maximum of 12 UEs~\\cite{3gpp_38_211}) multiplexed in the same time-frequency resources. Conventional decoding methods employ iterative correlation of the coherently combined signals with the known base sequences. This paper shows that a single NN model can replace the correlation operations, thus decoding the UCI from a single UE up to a maximum of 12 multiplexed UEs, with each UE transmitting any combination of HARQ and SR payloads.     \\item One of the challenges of correlation-based methods is their susceptibility to false detections. Conventional approaches to determine whether a UE has actually transmitted on the PUCCH involve signal power-based thresholds, which are often determined either based on observation or tedious simulations. We show that the NN model described in this paper is robust enough to identify false transmissions, thus eliminating the need for thresholds.     \\item This paper provides insights into the generation of training and testing wireless signal datasets derived from both MATLAB simulations and real-time over-the-air field captures taken at the indigenous 5G Testbed at IIT Madras~\\cite{5gtbiitm}.      \\item The proposed AI/ML model relies on extracting a map between the received PUCCH samples (input) and the applied phase rotation to the base sequence (output). At least two degrees of randomness are embedded in the input data. The first comes from the phase rotation, which is a function of the random UCI bits. The second comes from the fading channel and thermal noise, which we assume to be Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). In the presence of such randomness, neural networks often converge to the correct input-output relationship while obscuring the path they take to achieve convergence. This paper attempts to offer some insights into the interpretability of the model's behavior.     \\item AI/ML models must adhere to certain complexity, memory, and latency constraints to become deployable on hardware devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). To this end, this paper provides a complexity analysis of the NN models presented."

In 5G, Format 0 signalling is used as early as the initial attach procedure in which a UE is trying to latch onto a gNB. During the initial attach, there are several critical downlink transmissions, such as the Radio Resource Control (RRC) Setup, that need to be acknowledged, which the UE signals on PUCCH Format 0. It is to be noted that at this early stage of the connection process, neither the UE nor the gNB are expected to have obtained detailed information about the wireless surroundings. Consequently, Format 0 employs a sequence-based transmission in which phase-rotated versions of a pre-defined base sequence are transmitted by the UE. The UCI is encoded in the phase of the base sequence. Since the base sequence is assumed to be known at both ends, Format 0 signalling does not contain any pilot reference signals such as the Demodulation Reference Signals (DMRS), nor does it use Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) to modulate the UCI bits~\\cite{kundu2018physical}."

This is achieved by allocating different initial cyclic shifts (m_0) to each UE. Since the number of possible values of m_0 is limited to 12, the number of UEs that can be multiplexed is upper-bounded by 12. The maximum number of UEs that can be multiplexed is also driven by the UCI content. A few examples of this are shown in Figure~\\ref{fig: m_cs_mux_ue}. Figure~\\ref{fig: m_cs_mux_ue}a shows how assigning m_0 values of 0 through 5 to a maximum of 6 different UEs allows each of them to pick one of the two possible cyclic shifts and transmit 1 HARQ bit on the same resources. Similarly, Figure~\\ref{fig: m_cs_mux_ue}b shows that m_0 values of 0 through 2 allow for 3 UEs to be multiplexed when each of them transmits 2 HARQ bits (or 1 HARQ and 1 SR bit) with one of the four possible cyclic shifts. Additionally, multiplexing across different types of UCI content is possible, wherever applicable. For example, a UE transmitting 2 HARQ bits and an SR bit cannot be multiplexed with another transmitting the same combination but can be multiplexed with up to 3 more UEs transmitting SR bits or 1 more UE transmitting 2 HARQ bits (Figure~\\ref{fig: m_cs_mux_ue}c). Multiplexing of multiple UEs is possible as long as there are no overlaps in the assigned possible cyclic shifts for each of the UEs."

One example of such a scenario is the initial time synchronization between the gNB and the UE. Since the allocation of the synchronization sequences is unknown, longer correlations need to be performed. But, by the time the first Format 0 signal is received at the gNB, time and frequency synchronization are already achieved, and the gNB is aware of the UE's transmission~\\cite{wahlqvist1996time}. Since the allocation is known and is always 1 RB long, a simpler length 12 correlation is sufficient."

Since y(n)=e^j \u03b1 n\u00b7r\u0305_u,v(n), the multiplication of the base sequence r\u0305_u,v with its complex conjugate forces it to unity. The 12-point DFT of the resultant exponential term e^j \u03b1 n results in a peak at \u03b1. This is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig: correlation_1_ue} with a correlation peak at index = 4. The correlation index corresponding to the maximum correlation amplitude is taken as the estimated \u03b1 value. Recall from~\\eqref{eq: alpha} that \u03b1 is a combination of m_0, m_cs and n_cs. Therefore, upon the subtraction of m_0 + n_cs from \u03b1 (subtraction is modulo 12), the UCI-specific cyclic shift m_cs remains. In scenarios multiple users (N_UE of them) transmit PUCCH Format 0 signals in the same time-frequency location, the DFT algorithm selects the top N_UE peaks from the DFT output and uses them to determine the m_cs for each of the N_UE multiplexed UEs. Figure~\\ref{fig: correlation_3_ue} shows an example in which 3 UEs are multiplexed. In this case, we select the top 3 peaks (at index = 4, 6, and 8) as \u03b1 values."

The obtained \u03b1 values can then be mapped back to the UCI-specific cyclic shift m_cs for each UE by modulo 12 subtraction of the corresponding m_0 and n_cs which are provided by the higher layers (L2).  In the case no user is transmitting on the PUCCH (N_UE = 0), the NN prediction has to reflect this.

One way of developing such datasets is through state-of-the-art simulation tools, such as the MATLAB 5G Toolbox, which can generate near-accurate datasets under various channel impairments. Simulated data is a good starting point for training neural networks in communication problems. However, we note that including field data, if available, gives us an insight into the generalization performance of AI/ML models across different distributions of data. The inclusion of field data also aligns with 3GPP requirements for 5G Release 18~\\cite{3gpp_38_843}. For this paper, we use a combination of the above two approaches for data generation.

The hardware captures help represent channel states and hardware impairments not included in the training dataset. The setup (see Figure~\\ref{fig: hw_setup}) consists of an N5182B Vector Signal Generator (VSG) for transmitting the  5G signal at a center frequency of 3.49986 GHz (one of the sub-6 GHz channel raster in the n78 band). In our setup, the VSG acts like a UE, and it uses a commercial omnidirectional wideband monopole antenna to transmit the signals. The VSG is connected to the antenna through 2 SMA cables with 1.9 dB wire loss each. Here, commercial UEs could not be used because it is not easy to extract the actual transmitted information, i.e., ground truth labels for the UCI transmissions made by the UE. Also, the dynamic nature of the allocations made by the L2 scheduler makes it difficult to capture the data at the gNB for that particular time duration."

The RRH operates in the n78 band with 100 MHz bandwidth. It is ORAN-compliant and follows the 7.2b split as defined in~\\cite{ORAN_spec}. Other receiver components of the RRH include an in-house Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with 60dB gain at the receiver front end and an ADRV 9009 RF transceiver. We place the transmitter antenna one meter away from the receiver. The PUCCH Format 0 signal is transmitted from the VSG through an antenna, over the air, and then received at the RRH antenna, followed by the LNA and the transceiver. The signal out of the 16-bit ADC is then collected and used for testing."

The first is the received PUCCH Format 0 signal, and the second is metadata indicating the number of multiplexed UEs that the receiver expects. Since the PUCCH Format 0 signals occupy a single Resource Block, there are 12 received complex samples. We separate the real and imaginary parts of each complex number and concatenate them, resulting in a length 24 real sequence. As shown in Eq.~\\eqref{eq: pucch_rx_signal}, a given PUCCH resource block at the receiver could contain the sum of signals from multiple UEs. To aid the neural network, we also feed the number of multiplexed UEs as a 25th metadata input. The number of multiplexed UEs that a receiver should expect to see is often provided by an L2 scheduler as an upper bound, meaning that the received signal could contain less than or equal to the number of UEs indicated by L2. We denote the difference between the actual number of UEs multiplexed and the number of UEs indicated by L2 as \u0394. One example of a scenario this is observed is when the L2 scheduler allocates multiple UEs to transmit SR, but not all of the UEs have any data to transmit. In such cases, UEs that do not require PUSCH resources do not transmit the SR."

It serves two purposes - Ensemble Learning~\\cite{hara2016analysis} and Regularization~\\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Ensemble learning helps improve predictive performance by combining the outputs of multiple AI/ML models or multiple instances of the same AI/ML model trained on different subsets of data. However, training a large number of models is extremely prohibitive both in terms of time and computational resources. With dropout, in each backward pass, only a subset of weights are updated, effectively resulting in a new neural network. The subset of weights that are updated varies with each forward and backward pass, thus creating the combined effect of training several neural networks without the significant computational overhead. Dropout also has a regularizing effect on training in that it makes training noisy and, as a result, doesn't allow neurons to co-adapt. This means that neurons in one layer will learn not to depend on or compensate for other neurons because these very neurons may randomly be dropped out. This encourages neurons to become more independent, thus preventing overfitting. All the models described in this paper use dropout with a probability of 0.5 in each of the hidden layers."

The use of the sigmoid activation function is motivated by the fact that in a multi-label classifier, the sum of all the output probabilities need not be 1. Each individual output neuron can be thought to be a part of an independent binary classifier. In other words, since each output neuron corresponds to an \u03b1 value, the probabilities of each output neuron indicate the confidence with which the NN detects the presence of a certain UE with a certain \u03b1 value. The output probabilities are used to compute a binary cross entropy loss that is back-propagated using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 10^-2 and a momentum parameter of 0.9."

The training instances are designed such that they encompass all the possible cases of multiplexed UEs including the cases no UEs are transmitting. During training, we assume that the metadata input always holds the correct number of UEs present in the signal. Furthermore, based on the insights gained from our previous work~\\cite{yerrapragada2023machine}, we train the neural network only using data with a middle SNR of 10dB, rather than all the SNRs. We have found that this model achieves good generalization across the entire range of SNR during inference/testing. 75\\% of the data is used for training from which a further 30\\% is used for validation and fine-tuning of hyper-parameters. We train the model for 150 epochs(an epoch is 1 pass of the entire dataset through the neural network). The training and testing was done using Python and TensorFlow.

For example, \u0394 = 0 indicates that the number of UEs provided as the metadata input to the NN matches the number of UEs actually transmitting in the given allocation. \u0394 = 2 indicates that for each test instance, the number of UEs provided as the metadata input to the NN could be offset by any value between 0 and 2 with 0 being the best case (no offset) and 2 being the worst.

Though it is a useful high-level metric to gauge model performance, in cases the classes in a dataset are unequally distributed or when, as is the case in this paper, there are more than 2 classes, accuracy alone as a metric for an NN classifier does not offer the full picture of model performance. It is helpful to know if the model classifies all classes equally well or if it is more \"confused\" by certain classes compared to others. Hence, calculating a confusion matrix gives a better insight into any patterns that may exist in both correct and wrong classifications made by the model. In this paper, we show 3 types of confusion matrices: (1) A multi-label confusion matrix that shows how well each \u03b1 is predicted; (2) A confusion matrix showing how well the model predicts the correct number of multiplexed UEs, and (3) A confusion matrix showing how each value of \u03b1 (including the cases when no \u03b1 is selected) is classified. We present this last metric in the form of a column chart for ease of visualization. These 3 types of confusion matrices provide a sense of interpretability of the inner workings of the NN model."

Figure~\\ref{fig: loss_vs_epoch} shows the training and validation loss. Both curves follow the expected pattern for a well-fit model. The accuracy/loss gradually increases/decreases with epoch and eventually converges. We also note that the validation accuracy and loss values are slightly better than the corresponding training values. One possible explanation for this could be the use of dropout. As stated above, a dropout with probability 0.5 drops neurons 50% of the time during training. However, during validation and testing, the entire model is used, leading to a higher accuracy/lower loss."

For all values of \u0394, there is a significant SNR gain with the hardware data compared to simulated data. For example, when \u0394 = 0, the accuracy with hardware captured data reaches 100\\% at as low an SNR as 5 dB. In contrast, the accuracy with simulated data requires more than 15dB SNR to reach 100\\%. This difference could be attributed to the characteristics of the datasets themselves. The simulated dataset includes a strong fading component that impairs the transmitted signal. However, owing to the short propagation distance, such a strong fading component is absent in the current 5G testbed setup that was used to obtain the hardware captures. We note that the captures still incorporate other real-world impairments caused by front-end hardware elements like filters, DACs, ADCs, up/down converters, and amplifiers. In summary, the hardware dataset models impairments due to front-end elements well. It also models over-the-air impairments but does not encapsulate all characteristics of a typical communication link between a gNB and UE that might span hundreds of meters. On the other hand, the simulated data models over-the-air characteristics well but it doesn't model impairments due to hardware elements. We also point out that the IIT Madras 5G Testbed is moving towards deployment of Remote Radio Heads at on-campus sites which will allow the inclusion of even more realistic field data into future work."

Figure~\\ref{fig: acc_vs_mux_ue_hw} shows the test accuracy of the NN model versus the number of multiplexed UEs (N_UE) for hardware-captured data. In both cases, the test dataset for each N_UE contains a combination of all possible values of SNR = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20} dB. It is clear that the accuracy decreases as the maximum offset \u0394 increases. Note that no value is plotted when N_UE = 0 and \u0394=0 since this case corresponds to the scenario in which no UEs are transmitting on a given Resource Block and the receiver knows apriori that no UEs are scheduled as well. In this case, the receiver need not even run. When N_UE = 12, all the multiplexed UEs transmit only Scheduling Requests (SR). For both the simulated and hardware datasets, the DFT algorithm selects all 12 values from the 12-point DFT and assigns one value to each UE. Since all UEs are transmitting SRs, the order of assignment doesn't matter, and hence the accuracy is always 100\\%. The NN model also seems to recognize that the only scenario in which 12 UEs can be multiplexed is when they all transmit exactly the same information, i.e., SRs."

Figures~\\ref{fig: cm_multilabel_snr_20_off_0} and~\\ref{fig: cm_multilabel_snr_20_off_4} show the multi-label confusion matrix for the best (\u0394 = 0) and worst (\u0394 = 4) cases of 20dB SNR respectively, for both simulated data and hardware-captured data. Multi-label classification can be thought of as a combination of several independent binary classifiers. Diagonally dominant confusion matrices indicate that each of the binary classifiers is well-trained. For a given SNR, as \u0394 increases, the model leans more towards false positives because the model (whose 25th input is _UE \u2208 [N_UE, N_UE + \u0394]) is trying to predict _UE number of UEs. The value of \u0394 is always positive, meaning that the number of expected UEs, as indicated by L2, is always greater than or equal to the actual number of UEs transmitting on a given resource allocation. Hence, the model almost always over-predicts."

To gain a deeper understanding of the mistakes made by the model, consider the matrices in Figures~\\ref{fig: cm_num_UE_snr_0_off_0} to~\\ref{fig: cm_num_UE_snr_20_off_4}. For each instance of the received PUCCH signal, there are two characteristics to correct classification. The first characteristic is correctly identifying the number of multiplexed UEs (N_UE) embedded in the signal. Even though this is not an explicit output of the NN model, we believe that the model is learning to estimate the number of multiplexed UEs. Our belief is based on the fact that when the number of possible multiplexed UEs is not given as metadata to NN input, the accuracy drops significantly. The second characteristic of correct classification is derived from the explicit output of the NN model, which is the correct prediction of the value of \u03b1 for each of the multiplexed UEs."

Figures~\\ref{fig: cm_num_UE_snr_20_off_0} and ~\\ref{fig: cm_num_UE_snr_20_off_4} confusion matrices for the number of multiplexed UEs for both simulated data and hardware-captured data at an SNR of 20 dB and \u0394 values of 0 and 4 respectively. We notice that all the confusion matrices for the prediction of the number of multiplexed UEs are largely diagonally dominant. Furthermore, for any SNR, when \u0394 = 0, the error in the predicted number of UEs fluctuates between +1 and -1 in the majority of instances, confirming the high accuracy values in Figure~\\ref{fig: acc_vs_snr}. As \u0394 increases,  the error tends to grow on the positive side, meaning that the NN model predicts more UEs than actually present. As stated above, the overprediction is because \u0394 is always positive."

The result of the NN model's prediction for the scenario a particular \u03b1 has not been transmitted by any UE is also captured in the last column labeled No Tx. Correct prediction in the last column indicates that the model was able to correctly identify the non-transmission of a particular \u03b1 value, and incorrect detection determines the instances a particular \u03b1 has not been transmitted but incorrectly predicted."

However, from the context of sustaining a communication link between a gNB and a UE, a small number of false detections are more tolerable than missed detections. For example, when a gNB falsely detects a Scheduling Request, it allocates a small uplink bandwidth to the UE. Since the UE does not have any valid data to transmit, it would populate the uplink packet with padding information and indicate its lack of data in the Buffer Status Report (BSR)~\\cite{Lin_2018}. No further uplink grants will be allocated to the UE."

The number of trainable parameters increases with the number of layers and neurons. An increase in the number of trainable parameters leads directly to an increase in the latency incurred due to fetching the weights from memory and neural network computations. Current 5G systems function with fundamental time units on the order of hundreds of microseconds. To cater to this requirement, the processing of all the physical layer channels allocated to each user must be completed in a duration of the order of tens of microseconds. For example, in our 5G Testbed~\\cite{5gtbiitm}, we use a subcarrier spacing of 30kHz, which translates to a slot duration of 500\u03bc s. Hence, the physical layer processing of all the users allocated in that slot needs to be completed within this time frame. If 10 PUCCH Format 0 instances are allocated in an uplink slot, each of them should be processed in no more than 50\u03bc s. This time constraint also applies to AI/ML-based approaches such as neural networks. Hence, FPGAs are a promising choice for hardware implementation of such time-constrained neural networks."

The proposed UCINet0 model is a multi-label classifier that showed superior performance compared to conventional correlation-based approaches by a significant margin. The inclusion of field datasets in the testing of the model ensures robustness and the ability of the network to work in a wide range of scenarios. In addition to standard AI/ML metrics like accuracy, we have also provided insights into the interpretability of the NN model through confusion matrices and column charts of detection percentages of individual classes."

Following this framework, various domain adaptation approaches have been developed. Specifically, the stabilized regression (SR) approach relies on a weaker form of invariance dependent on expectation as opposed to probability. The common assumption for the approaches mentioned is that the assignment of Y does not change over environments. In a causal sense, from which much of the literature in this area stems, this is referred to as an intervention on Y. When Y is intervened, the invariance principle, as well as the frameworks mentioned above, fail. In a series of recent works, an alternative approach called the invariant matching property (IMP) has been developed to detect linear invariant models in a regression setting even when the assignment of Y is altered over environment.",

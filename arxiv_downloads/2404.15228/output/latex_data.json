            "content": "Inverse graphics  the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene  is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains. Inspired by the zeroshot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inversegraphics problems. To this end, we propose the InverseGraphics Large Language Model (\\mbox{IGLLM}), an inversegraphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3Dscene representation. We incorporate a frozen pretrained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable endtoend training. Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through nexttoken prediction, without the use of imagespace supervision. Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs. We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at \\hbox{https://igllm.is.tue.mpg.de/}",

Commonly employed program types include constructivesolid geometry (CSG), computeraided design (CAD), vector graphics (e.g., SVG), and Lsystems, as well as custom program domains. Program discovery can be achieved from simplified representations of the same modality, such as 2D hand drawings or synthetic patterns, as well as 3D meshes and voxels. There have also been efforts in recovering 3D scenes from natural 2D images using graphics programs. propose a probabilistic programming language for representing arbitrary 2D/3D scenes, demonstrating preliminary results for analysis of faces, bodies, and objects. infer customdesigned markup code from images that can be easily translated to rendererfriendly inputs. The work can handle scenes with a number of objects, but cannot generalize beyond the training data distribution. In followup work, investigate how graphics programs can be used for visual question answering (VQA). However, their scene reconstruction also struggles with generalization problems, particularly to unseen attribute combinations. present a new language for representing scenes, along with a hierarchical approach for inference. MetaSIM uses probabilistic scene grammars to recover synthetic scenes from natural images, which are then used to train a generative scenesynthesis model.

Dating back to Larry Roberts's BlocksWorld thesis, there has been a long history of work that treats computer vision as the inverse problem to computer graphics. Efforts have included estimating object pose and reconstructing shape from single images. Multiobject scenes have also been recovered via geometric approaches, but they often overlook the semantics and interrelation between objects, hindering further reasoning. Holistic 3Dscene understanding takes the approach a step further by reconstructing individual objects together with the scene layout. Early methods focus on estimating 3D boundingbox representations, whereas morerecent works emphasize the reconstruction of finer shapes along with instance segmentations. Closely related are methods that perform CAD or meshmodel retrieval followed by 6DOF pose estimation of individual objects or scenes. An alternative to detailed shape reconstruction is primitive reconstruction, where objects or scenes are explained by a limited set of geometric primitives, offering a higher level of abstraction. This direction has been studied extensively, and it is still actively researched. While these works typically produce accurate reconstructions, they involve complex pipelines with multiple modules and require special training data, limiting generalization under distribution shifts. In contrast, we explore the use of LLMs as a potentially simpler and moregeneralizable solution to the inversegraphics problem.",

Although the floatbased model exhibits a slight positional bias toward predicting positions on the grid (as evidenced by the higher OOD error), the disparity in the IDOOD validationL2 performance gap of the charbased model is 14 times as high as that of the floatbased model (). Moreover, the validation MSE of the floatbased model converges quickly to near zero, while the error of the charbased model is much less stable over time (), suggesting that the floatbased model learns smooth, lowdimensional representations of the space while the charbased variant may not.",

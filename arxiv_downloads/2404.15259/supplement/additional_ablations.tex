In \cref{tab:ablations_supplemental}, we include three additional ablations.
The ``Random Init.'' ablation uses a randomly initialized CNN for FlowMap training with 2,000 steps of optimization.
The ``Random Init. (20k)'' ablation is identical, but runs for 20,000 optimization steps.
The ``No Corresp. Weights'' ablation removes the correspondence weights used in FlowMap's Procrustes-solving step.
We note that the ``Random Init. (20k)'' ablation's performance almost matches FlowMap's, indicating that although pre-training helps FlowMap converge much more quickly, it is not necessary for accuracy.
In \cref{tab:ablations_supplemental_full}, we report per-scene ablation results.
Finally, \cref{fig:convergence} compares convergence between FlowMap and the free-variable parameterization variants on more scenes.

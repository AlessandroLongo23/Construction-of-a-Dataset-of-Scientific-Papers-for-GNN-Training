     \caption{\textbf{PatchMatch.} Frame (a) and (b) both contain geometry-informative flow, but due to the ambiguity of optical flow relating depth and speed of motion, different frames in the depth-variable optimization converge to different solutions; using a depth CNN yields a consistent solution to this ambiguity across frames. And in the case of small or rotation-dominant motion (c), the flow does not sufficiently inform geometry and the optimized depth is mostly planar.}

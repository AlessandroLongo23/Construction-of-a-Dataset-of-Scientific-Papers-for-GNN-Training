    \caption{\textbf{Large-scale Robustness Study.}
    We run FlowMap and DROID-SLAM on 420 CO3D scenes across 10 categories and plot mean ATEs with respect to CO3D's COLMAP-generated pose metadata.
    We also re-run COLMAP on the same data.
    Compared to DROID-SLAM, which requires ground-truth intrinsics, FlowMap produces notably lower ATEs.
    FlowMap's ATE distribution is similar to one obtained by re-running COLMAP, with most ATEs falling under 0.005 in both cases.}

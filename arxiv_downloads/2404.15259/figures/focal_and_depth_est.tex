    \caption{In (a) we illustrate our implicit focal length formulation, which considers a set of candidate focal lengths, assigns each one an error score, and softly selects the focal length with the lowest error. To calculate the error score for a focal length, we use that focal length to estimate a pose, and then compare the resulting pose-induced optical flow to the ground truth optical flow. In (b) we illustrate that we parameterize depth via the output of a monocular depth prediction CNN. }

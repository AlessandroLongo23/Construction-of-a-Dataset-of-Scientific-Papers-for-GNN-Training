    We present FlowMap, an end-to-end differentiable method that recovers poses, intrinsics, and depth maps of an input video.
    FlowMap is supervised only with off-the-shelf optical flow and point track correspondences, and optimized per-scene with gradient descent.
    Gaussian Splats obtained from FlowMap's reconstructions regularly match or exceed those obtained from COLMAP in quality.

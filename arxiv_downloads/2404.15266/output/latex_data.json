Our approach relies on the HongOuMandel effect, for which the probability that two photons exit a beam splitter in different modes, depends on their distinguishability . In our implementation, an input object is targeted by a singlephoton source, and eventually followed by an arbitrary lens system. The singlephoton state interferes with another one, which encodes a set of trainable parameters, e.g. through a spatial light modulator. Classification occurs by measuring the rate of twophoton coincidences at the HongOuMandel output (see ). The HongOuMandel effect has been successfully applied to quantum kernel evaluation, which can compute distances between pairs of data points in the feature space. In this case, each point is sent to one branch of the interferometer, encoded in the temporal modes of a singlephoton state. In our method, the interferometer has only one independent branch, which takes the spatial modes of a singlephoton state reflected off the target object. The other branch remains fixed after training, and contains the layer of parameters. After the measurement, the response function of our apparatus mathematically resembles that of a classical neuron. For this reason, we refer to our setup as quantum optical neuron. By analytically comparing the resource cost of the classical and quantum neurons, we show that our method requires constant ùí™(1) computational operations and injected photons, whereas the classical methods are at least linear in the image resolution: a superexponential advantage.",

We guaranteed a fair comparison by increasing the MNIST resolution to 32 √ó 32 pixels (separately padding each image of the dataset), while converting the CIFAR10 to greyscale. We represent each element of the dataset as (xj, yj), where yj ‚àà0, 1 is the true class label, and xj is the input vector, obtained by discretizing and vectorizing either the amplitudes ‚Ñê or their Fourier spectrum ‚ÑêÃÇ, thus bypassing the simulation of the imaging optics. We adopt the binary crossentropy as loss function, combined with the standard (nonstochastic) gradient descent optimizer.

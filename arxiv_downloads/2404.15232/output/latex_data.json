By combining Planck2018 and DESI data, we observe a preference for interactions exceeding the 95% confidence level, yielding a presentday expansion rate H0=71.4±1.5 km/s/Mpc, in agreement with SH0ES. This preference remains robust when including measurements of the expansion rate H(z) obtained from the relative ages of massive, earlytime, and passivelyevolving galaxies, as well as when considering distance moduli measurements from TypeIa Supernovae sourced from the Pantheonplus catalog using the SH0ES Cepheid host distances as calibrators. Overall, high and low redshift data can be equally or better explained within the IDE framework compared to ΛCDM, while also yielding higher values of H0 in better agreement with the local distance ladder estimate.",

In the bottom panel of the same figure, we show the distance between the observed DESI data points and the bestfit predictions obtained for ΛCDM ('o'shaped points) and IDE ('x'shaped points) in units of observational uncertainty σ. The same difference between the model predictions and DESI data is summarized in Tab.. Comparing the bestfit predictions for IDE and ΛCDM, some important conclusions can be reached. Foremost, we see that the only two data points that are in disagreement with IDE at a level exceeding 2σ are the measurements of DM(z)/(rd √(z)) and z DH(z) / (rd√(z)) at z=0.51. However, the same two (correlated) data points are also in significant disagreement with ΛCDM, especially z DH(z) / (rd√(z)). Conversely, IDE is more successful in explaining DM(z)/(rd √(z)) at z=0.71 than ΛCDM. Overall, apart from the DESI distance measurements at z=0.51 (which  repetita iuvant  are at odds also with ΛCDM), there are no other BAO measurements in tension with the IDE bestfit predictions. Remarkably, the bestfit value for H0∼ 73.26 obtained by Planck2018+DESI is fully consistent with SH0ES. Last but not least, we stress that for Planck2018+BAO, the larger part of the improvement in the total Δχ^2=2.33 over ΛCDM comes exactly from the DESI BAO measurement (Δχ^2DESI=1.52)For Planck2018+DESI+CC, such improvement in the fit of DESI BAO measurements becomes even more significant: Δχ^2DESI=2.34..",

In particular, in Fig., we compare the Planck2018+DESI bestfit predictions for the three different types of (rescaled) distances probed by BAO measurements. In the bottom panel of the same figure, we show the distance between the observed DESI data points and the bestfit predictions obtained for ΛCDM ('o'shaped points) and IDE ('x'shaped points) in units of observational uncertainty σ.

Combining Planck2018+DESI with either measurements of the expansion rate H(z) obtained from the relative ages of massive, earlytime, and passivelyevolving galaxies or with distance moduli measurements from TypeIa Supernovae sourced from the Pantheonplus catalog using the SH0ES Cepheid host distances as a calibrator, we still find a preference for ξ≠ 0 at more than 95% CL. For all the different combinations of datasets, we observe an improvement in the χ^2 of the fit over ΛCDM. Overall, accounting for DESI measurements, high and low redshift data are found to be equally or better explained within the IDE framework than ΛCDM, while consistently yielding values of H0 that are higher than in the standard cosmological model and in much better agreement with local distance ladder estimates.

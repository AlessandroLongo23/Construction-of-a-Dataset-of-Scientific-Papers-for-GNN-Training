To show the ability of Parts2Whole to generate human image conditions on different types of pose maps, we train a new Parts2Whole model but with \textbf{OpenPose} as a condition. As shown in \cref{fig:supp_openpose}, the generated images strictly maintain consistency with the target pose, and each body part retains the appearance information from the reference images.

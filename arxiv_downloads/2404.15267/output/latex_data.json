Yet, generating human images conditioned on multiple parts of human appearance remains challenging. Addressing this, we introduce Parts2Whole, a novel framework designed for generating customized portraits from multiple reference images, including pose images and various aspects of human appearance. To achieve this, we first develop a semanticaware appearance encoder to retain details of different human parts, which processes each image based on its textual label to a series of multiscale feature maps rather than one image token, preserving the image dimension. Second, our framework supports multiimage conditioned generation through a shared selfattention mechanism that operates across reference and target features during the diffusion process. We enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by incorporating mask information from the reference human images, allowing for the precise selection of any part. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing alternatives, offering advanced capabilities for multipart controllable human image customization.",

The abovementioned generation methods conditioned on structural signals or face identity have their limitations on this task (results shown in and ). It is attributed to the spatial misalignment of the input multibody parts with the target image, and the lack of specific design in existing methods to address the variation in spatial positions during feature injection. Methods like IPAdapter and SSREncoder incorporate features into the denoising UNet through crossattention mechanisms. They encode reference images into other modal features (e.g., semantic features) and utilize the crossattention keys and values from them rather than from image dimensional feature maps. As a result, the spatial relationship in the original image dimensions between the reference images and the target image is lost, resulting in a mixture of attributes from different subjects. Although methods like ControlNet encode the reference images into imagedimensional features, they add the features to the feature maps in the UNet decoder. It is suitable for tasks where the condition maps and the target map have the same structure, such as guiding generation using line drawings. However, in the case of the spatial misalignment of the conditional images with the target image, it is difficult to model the correlation of spatial information by directly adding or concat features on the channel dimension.",

Inspired by the effective reference mechanism used in imagetovideo tasks, we develop a semanticaware appearance encoder based on the Reference UNet architecture. It encodes each image with its textual label into a series of multiscale feature maps in image dimension, preserving appearance details and spatial information of multiple reference images. The additional semantic condition represents a category instruction, which helps retain richer shapes and detailed attributes of each aspect. Furthermore, to preserve the positional relationship when injecting reference features into the image generation process, we employ a shared selfattention operation across reference and target features during the diffusion process. We also build a tiny convolution network to extract the pose features and inject them into the generation. To precisely select the specified part from each reference image, we enhance the vanilla selfattention mechanism by incorporating masks of the subjects in the reference images.",

Since DALLE2, Stable Diffusion and Imagen employ diffusion models as generative models and train the models on large datasets, texttoimage synthesis ability has been significantly enhanced. More recently, Stable Diffusion XL, a twostage cascade diffusion model, has greatly improved the generation of highfrequency details and overall image color, taking aesthetic appeal to a higher level. However, these existing methods are limited to generating images solely from text prompts, and they do not meet the demand for producing customized images with the preservation of appearance.",

Some work focuses on introducing structural signals such as edges, depth maps, and segmentation maps, to control the spatial structure of generated images. Another group of work uses appearance conditions to guide image generation, aiming to generate images aligning with specific concepts like identity and style, known as subjectdriven image generation. The methods generally fall into two categories: those requiring testtime finetuning and those that do not. Testtime finetuning methods often optimizes additional text embedding, parameter residuals or direct finetune the whole model to fit the specified subject. Although these methods have achieved impressive results, they cost about half an hour to achieve satisfactory results. Finetuningfree methods typically train an additional encoding network to encode the reference image into embeddings or image prompts. However, due to the loss of spatial representations when encoding the reference images into one or a few tokens, they struggle to preserve appearance details.",

With the addition of adaptable structural control networks, these methods can generate portraits aligned with specified poses and human identities. However, they usually fail to maintain the details of human identities and utilize all the information from a single image, resulting in ambiguous subject representation.

In detail, our framework mainly consists of three crucial components: 1) SemanticAware Appearance Encoder, encoding the multiscale features of various human parts from reference images; 2) Shared SelfAttention, which obtains detailed information and spatial information by sharing keys and values in selfattention layers between denoising UNet and appearance encoder, and supports pose control by utilizing a lightweight pose encoder; 3) Enhanced MaskGuided Subject Selection, achieving precisely subject selection by explicitly introducing subject masks into the selfattention mechanism.",

Specifically, we adopt a framework identical to the denoising UNet for the appearance encoder. Unlike the denoising branch, we do not add any noise to the reference images. Given N images capturing various parts of human appearance, we first compress them into latent features and then input them into the copied trainable UNet. Instead of simply piecing multiple reference images together, we pass the latent features of different parts through the appearance encoder one by one and provide a textual class label for each part. These text labels, such as face, hair, upper body clothes, etc., are converted into feature representations by CLIP text encoder and then injected into the appearance encoder through crossattention. This simple yet effective external condition provides a classifierlike guidance, which enables the encoder to have semantic awareness of different parts of the human appearance rather than simply performing operations such as image downsampling and upsampling. This helps produce results that are not only rich in detail, but also flexible and realistic.",

Fig.~ presents this mechanism. Starting with a patch s on a feature map ^0 in the denoising UNet, and subject masks M^1:N on the N reference images. When computing the attention map between the one in the denoising UNet and those from the appearance encoder, patches that do not lie in these masks are ignored. Hence, the target patch s only has access to features of the subjects specified by masks in the reference images, thereby avoiding interference from other elements such as the background.

For example, different images are tagged with the same ID but depict different individuals. To address this issue, we first cleanse the IDs by extracting facial ID features from images tagged with the same ID using InsightFace. Cosine similarity is then used to evaluate the similarity between image ID feature pairs to distinguish between different ID images within the same ID group. Subsequently, we utilize DWPose to generate pose images corresponding to each image. Guided by human parsing files, we crop human images into various parts. Due to the low resolution of the cropped parts, we apply RealESRGAN to enhance the image resolution, thus obtaining clearer reference images. Textual descriptions of the original dataset are used as captions. For constructing pairs, we select images with cleaned IDs that feature the same clothes and individual but in different poses. Specifically, a pair contains multiple parts from one human image as reference images, and an image of the person in another pose as the target. Finally, we build a total of about 41,500 pairs, of which the training set is about 40,000 and the test set is about 1,500 pairs.",

DreamBooth LoRA inserts a smaller number of new weights into Stable Diffusion and only trains these parameters on just a few images of a subject or style, thereby associating a special word in the prompt with the example images. Custom Diffusion finetunes only key and value projection matrices in the crossattention layers to customize texttoimage models. Given as input several aspects of human appearance, we use these two methods to finetune Stable Diffusion, such that it learns to bind identifiers with specific human parts. As shown in, when it comes to multiaspect composition, the attributes of different parts in images generated by these tuningbase methods mix together, resulting in unrealistic human images.

For quantitative comparison, we compute the commonly used CLIP score and DINO score to evaluate the similarity between the generated image and the specified human parts. For further alignment evaluation, we use DreamSim, a new metric for perceptual image similarity that bridges the gap between ''lowlevel'' metrics (e.g., LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) and ''highlevel'' measures (e.g., CLIP). Since the generated image is conditioned on multiple parts of human appearance, it is difficult to evaluate the degree of alignment by calculating the average metric with these multiple images. Therefore, we calculate the above three indicators between the output image and the original reference portrait from which these different parts come. We present the quantitative results in and the qualitative results in ~. Both IPAdapter and SSREncoder fail to maintain alignment with the specified appearance images and often produce unrealistic results when multipart combinations are involved. In comparison, our method achieves the best results in terms of image quality and appearance alignment.",

Here, we compare it to the baseline with other image encoders. Specifically, we leverage the CLIP image encoder, DINOv2, and ControlNet as feature extractors and apply the same training settings for fair comparison. The qualitative results of generated human images are presented in . From the second and third columns of the figure, we observe that these semanticlevel feature extractors cannot preserve the appearance details of multiple reference images and only extract color and rough texture. ControlNet directly adds different image features with misaligned structures to the feature maps, resulting in unstable image quality. In contrast, our proposed appearance encoder provides finegrained details of multiple aspects of human appearance.",

Based on a dual UNet design, we develop a semanticaware appearance encoder to process each condition image with its label into multiscale feature maps and inject those detailrich reference features into the generation via a shared selfattention mechanism. This design retains details from multiple references and looks very good. We also enhance vanilla selfattention by incorporating subject masks, enabling Parts2Whole to synthesize human images from specified parts from condition images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Parts2Whole performs well in terms of image quality and condition alignment.",

For example, DreamBooth LoRA encountered cases where pants were omitted, and both Custom Diffusion and SSREncoder show alterations in facial ID. The phenomenon observed is attributed to the spatial misalignment of the input multibody parts with the target image, and the lack of specific design in existing methods to address the variation in spatial positions during feature injection. For instance, methods like SSREncoder, Custom Diffusion, and IPAdapter incorporate features into the denoising UNet through crossattention mechanisms. They encode reference images into other modal features (e.g. semantic features) and utilize the crossattention keys (K) and values (V) from them rather than from image dimensional feature maps. In this process, the correlation between the reference images and the target image loses the spatial relationship of the original image dimensions. It is difficult for these methods to effectively model the attention from various conditional feature maps at different locations in the target image, resulting in a mixture of attributes from different subjects.",

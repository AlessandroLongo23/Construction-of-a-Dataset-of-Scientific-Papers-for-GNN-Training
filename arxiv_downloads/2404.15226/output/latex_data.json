            "content": "We revisit the ''granular models of firm growth'' that have been proposed in the literature over the past two decades to explain the anomalously slow decrease of growth volatility with firms size and how this phenomenon shapes the distribution of their growth rates. In these models, firms' sales are viewed as collections of independent ''subunits'', and these nontrivial statistical properties occur as a direct result of the fattailed distribution of the number or sizes of these subunits. In revisiting these models we present and discuss new theoretical results on the relation between firm size and growth rate statistics. Our results can be understood intuitively by noting that granular models imply the existence of three types of firms: welldiversified firms, with a size evenly distributed among several subunits; firms with many subunits but with their total size concentrated on only a handful of them, and lastly firms which are poorly diversified simply because they are made up of a small number of subunits. Inspired by our theoretical insights, we establish new empirical facts about growth rates and their relation with size. As predicted by the model, the distribution of growth rate volatilities is to a good approximation { independent of firm size}, once rescaled by the average sizeconditioned volatility. However, the tail of this distribution is {\\it much too thin} to be consistent with a granular mechanism. Moreover, the moments of growth volatility conditional on size scale with size in a way that is unambiguously at odds with theoretical predictions. We also find that the distribution of growth rates rescaled by firmspecific volatility, which is predicted to be Gaussian by all the models we consider, remains very fattailed in the data, even for large firms. This paper, in ruling out the granularity scenario, suggests that the overarching mechanisms underlying the growth of firms are not satisfactorily understood, and argues that they deserve further theoretical investigations.",

In particular, we show that growth volatility is not only driven by firm size but by a more complicated interplay between a firm's size and its structure.

Such a description, in spite of being well adapted to the description of large firms, paints very different pictures of how well diversified they are, an issue also raised in the international trade literature by. We show that the coexistence of these three types of firms has a direct impact on the shape of the growth volatility distribution and we derive nontrivial results on the scaling laws of its first four moments.

Our first contribution is the determination of new empirical facts about the growth dynamics of business firms. Guided by the theoretical considerations above, we show that the distribution of the growth rate volatility, once rescaled by its average conditional on size, is to a good approximation independent of firm size, and is well approximated by an Inverse Gamma distribution, which features a powerlaw right tail. We also document that the first four moments of growth volatility, and not only the average, scale down with size as a powerlaw. Our second contribution is to show that although these observations are to a first approximation in good qualitative agreement with granular models of growth, a deeper investigation unveils three major inconsistencies. The first of these is that the tail of the empirical distribution of the growth volatility is much too thin to be compatible with the tail a granular model would predict. This means that we do not observe large volatilities in the data as often as predicted by a calibrated granular model. The second empirical inconsistency is that moments higher than order one do not all decrease with size at the same scaling rate, at odds with what the model predicts. Finally, the last inconsistency is that the two granular models we have analyzed imply that a firm's growth rate, when rescaled by the firmdependent volatility, should be distributed as a Gaussian random variable. We expect this to be true in particular for large firms: since in the two models their growth rates are the sum of a large number of (possibly nonGaussian) independent random variables, the Central Limit Theorem predicts that they should be partially Gaussian. However, their empirical distribution deviates from a Gaussian benchmark, and we quantify this deviation by proposing a generic family of distributions that features a Gaussian central region of varying width and exponentially ''stretched'' tails. Somewhat surprisingly, parametric fits of these distributions show that the tails do not gradually disappear when considering larger firms, even though they do (at a slow rate) when considering longer time horizons in building growth rates.",

This case corresponds to a scenario where large firms are most likely made up of a large number of subunits K ∼ S/ and the tail of P(S) simply mirrors that of the distribution P(K). The second term, on the other hand, corresponds to much rarer cases where large firms are made up of a handful of large subunits (hence explaining why the tail behavior has an exponent μ), and are thus poorly diversified. The relative probability that large firms are in this second category, we denote with π(Si), behaves as (Cμ/Cα) Si^α  μ and goes to 0 for large Si. Although it does not provide an explanation to why the number and size of the subunits should be Pareto distributed,There exists a large class of general and intuitive processes that generate Pareto distributions in both Ki and sji.

The second term, on the other hand, corresponds to much rarer cases where large firms are made up of a handful of large subunits (hence explaining why the tail behavior has an exponent μ), and are thus poorly diversified.

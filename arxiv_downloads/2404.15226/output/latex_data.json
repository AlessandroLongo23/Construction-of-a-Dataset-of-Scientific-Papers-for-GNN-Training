            "content": "We revisit the ''granular models of firm growth'' that have been proposed in the literature over the past two decades to explain the anomalously slow decrease of growth volatility with firms size and how this phenomenon shapes the distribution of their growth rates. In these models, firms' sales are viewed as collections of independent ''subunits'', and these nontrivial statistical properties occur as a direct result of the fattailed distribution of the number or sizes of these subunits. In revisiting these models we present and discuss new theoretical results on the relation between firm size and growth rate statistics. Our results can be understood intuitively by noting that granular models imply the existence of three types of firms: welldiversified firms, with a size evenly distributed among several subunits; firms with many subunits but with their total size concentrated on only a handful of them, and lastly firms which are poorly diversified simply because they are made up of a small number of subunits. Inspired by our theoretical insights, we establish new empirical facts about growth rates and their relation with size. As predicted by the model, the distribution of growth rate volatilities is to a good approximation { independent of firm size}, once rescaled by the average sizeconditioned volatility. However, the tail of this distribution is {\\it much too thin} to be consistent with a granular mechanism. Moreover, the moments of growth volatility conditional on size scale with size in a way that is unambiguously at odds with theoretical predictions. We also find that the distribution of growth rates rescaled by firmspecific volatility, which is predicted to be Gaussian by all the models we consider, remains very fattailed in the data, even for large firms. This paper, in ruling out the granularity scenario, suggests that the overarching mechanisms underlying the growth of firms are not satisfactorily understood, and argues that they deserve further theoretical investigations.",

As is well documented in the literature, the distribution is to a large extent symmetric, which in itself is somewhat unexpected, and features a ''cusp'' in the central part along with slowly decaying tails. This implies relatively frequent episodes of extreme growth or extreme decline: the probability to observe sales multiplied or divided by more than 150 is as large as one in one thousand, an event nearly impossible if the growth rates follow a Gaussian distribution.",

The estimate is computed using the entire sample pooling annual (log) growth rates across firms and yearquarter with a Gaussian kernel function and a bandwidth chosen according to the normal reference ruleofthumb. The estimate is evaluated on a 10,000 points regular grid defined over the entire empirical range. We also report the 95% confidence interval and the Gaussian parametric fit (dotted line). We add the empirical density of synthetic growth rates (green line) obtained by mixing Gaussian random shocks with growth volatilities bootstrapped from those estimated according to σ(S) ∝ S^β, as suggested by the right panel, and a Normal fit (black line). Rightpanel displays on a double logscale the binned relation between firms growth volatility and average normalized size. Each point represents the average size and the average volatility of the growth rates of firms belonging to the same size bin where volatility is proxied with the mean absolute deviation adjusted by the factor √(π/2). We also report a powerlaw fit σ(S)∝ S^β where the exponent β is found approximately equal to 0.204 with an asymptotic standard error of 0.01.

In particular, we show that growth volatility is not only driven by firm size but by a more complicated interplay between a firm's size and its structure. This is explained by showing that these models imply the existence of three different types of firms: those with sales evenly distributed among a large number of subunits, those with a large number of subunits but with their sales concentrated only on a few of them, and lastly those made up of only a handful of subunits. Such a description, in spite of being well adapted to the description of large firms, paints very different pictures of how well diversified they are, an issue also raised in the international trade literature by. We show that the coexistence of these three types of firms has a direct impact on the shape of the growth volatility distribution and we derive nontrivial results on the scaling laws of its first four moments. This allows us to discuss in details the distribution of the growth rates predicted by the model since in this framework it simply results from mixing Gaussian random variables using the volatility distribution as a mixing function.",

Our first contribution is the determination of new empirical facts about the growth dynamics of business firms. Guided by the theoretical considerations above, we show that the distribution of the growth rate volatility, once rescaled by its average conditional on size, is to a good approximation independent of firm size, and is well approximated by an Inverse Gamma distribution, which features a powerlaw right tail. We also document that the first four moments of growth volatility, and not only the average, scale down with size as a powerlaw. Our second contribution is to show that although these observations are to a first approximation in good qualitative agreement with granular models of growth, a deeper investigation unveils three major inconsistencies. The first of these is that the tail of the empirical distribution of the growth volatility is much too thin to be compatible with the tail a granular model would predict. This means that we do not observe large volatilities in the data as often as predicted by a calibrated granular model. The second empirical inconsistency is that moments higher than order one do not all decrease with size at the same scaling rate, at odds with what the model predicts. Finally, the last inconsistency is that the two granular models we have analyzed imply that a firm's growth rate, when rescaled by the firmdependent volatility, should be distributed as a Gaussian random variable. We expect this to be true in particular for large firms: since in the two models their growth rates are the sum of a large number of (possibly nonGaussian) independent random variables, the Central Limit Theorem predicts that they should be partially Gaussian. However, their empirical distribution deviates from a Gaussian benchmark, and we quantify this deviation by proposing a generic family of distributions that features a Gaussian central region of varying width and exponentially ''stretched'' tails. Somewhat surprisingly, parametric fits of these distributions show that the tails do not gradually disappear when considering larger firms, even though they do (at a slow rate) when considering longer time horizons in building growth rates.",

The economic interpretation behind this unexpected result is that the model describes a market where two types of large firms coexist. The first type is composed by poorly diversified firms with an abnormally high HHi (ℋ≈ 1), namely firms with one or two dominant subunits in terms of sales. These high values of the HHi drive the behavior of √(E[ℋ|K]). The second type is composed, on the contrary, by well diversified large firms representing the typical case. These are dominant in driving 𝔼[√(ℋ)| K]. The existence of the first type of large firms, overlooked in, is at the origin of the anomalous scaling exponents. Further it has important consequences on the behavior of the growth volatilities σi and ultimately on the shape of the growth rates distribution. Two aspects we investigate below.",

                                    "content": "Since α < μ, this proposition implies that the first term dominates and determines the tail of the size distribution. This case corresponds to a scenario where large firms are most likely made up of a large number of subunits K ∼ S/s and the tail of P(S) simply mirrors that of the distribution P(K). The second term, on the other hand, corresponds to much rarer cases where large firms are made up of a handful of large subunits (hence explaining why the tail behavior has an exponent μ), and are thus poorly diversified. The relative probability that large firms are in this second category, we denote with π(Si), behaves as (Cμ/Cα) Si^α  μ and goes to 0 for large Si. Although it does not provide an explanation to why the number and size of the subunits should be Pareto distributed,There exists a large class of general and intuitive processes that generate Pareto distributions in both Ki and sji. One example is to assume that the subunits of a firm grow according to a mixture of stochastic growth and redistribution between them as in sijt+1 sijt=ηijt+1 sijt+γ(1Ki∑k=1^Ki sikt  sijt) where the first term accounts for stochastic multiplicative growth and the term with γ for a net flow going from larger subunits into smaller subunits. See for details. Proposition clarifies that the tail of the firm size distribution inherits its behavior from the distribution featuring the heavier tail between those of the subunit size and number.",

We define a normalized quarter size as Siqy=NyS̃iqy∑iqS̃iqy where Ny represent the number of quarter size observations available in year y. This normalization is important stationarize the size distribution. To simplify the notation, we absorb qy into a time subscript t. Since our data records firm size at the quarterly frequency we define annual growth rates as the logarithmic difference over one year, git=ln(Sit+4)  ln(Sit), rolling over quarters to maximize the number of observations. Similarly when we work with the growth rate of the nonnormalized size S̃it. For each firm we then compute a single averaged (across years) normalized size Si, and we investigate its growth dynamics considering the corresponding annual growth rates git. After removing firms for which we do not observe at least two growth rates, we are left with 24,233 (out of a total of 38,995) companies, corresponding to over one million growth rate observations. Companies in the Compustat sample tend to be large, since they are publicly traded, with an average quarterly Total Sales value of about 450 millions in 2012 USD and a positive average growth rate. For each firm we observe on average 46 growth rates, a number that should limit concerns about the potential noise affecting the firm growth volatility estimates we compute in the paper. Descriptive statistics on the sample used are reported in Appendix~.",

This technique consists in grouping firms based on their size and compute for each group (i.e. bin) some statistics of the corresponding growth rates. In the following, we set the number of bins to 25 and we assign each firm to each bin based on its average normalized size S̅i=1Ti∑t Sit. The bins are defined so that they contain the same number of firms. We then compute for each firm the corresponding growth volatility, proxied by the adjusted mean absolute deviation σi =√(π2)1Ti∑t |gitg̅i|, where g̅i is the sample average growth rate of firm i computed over Ti observations.A bar over a variable indicates from now on the corresponding sample average. In this definition, the correcting factor √(π2) comes from the observation that for a centered Normal distribution E[| X|]/√(E[X^2])=√(2π), so that the mean absolute deviation is a lowmoment estimator for the standard deviation. We then compute the average size and volatility across firms belonging to the same bin. We implement this procedure also for higher absolute moments of the volatility we denote as σi^q with q=2,3,4.",

Figure~ in Appendix~). Second, attrition in a panel of firms over such a long period of time may affect the quality of our estimates of σi, obtained as the mean absolute deviation, in particular considering firms with a low number of growth rates. To alleviate this concern we look at the growth volatility distribution for firms with at least 20 growth rates. Figure~, reported in Appendix~, show that the message with this alternative sample does not change. In particular the estimated exponent for the power law tail of the function G(x) remains too high, being (1+4.6). As a third, and final check, since Compustat mixes firms reporting their balance sheet with respect to different fiscal years, we focus on firms closing their accounts in December.

Because α>1, the theory predicts that all of them should decay with size in the same way, as S^αμ. Unfortunately this is not what we observe in the remaining three panels of Figure~. While they all conform to a power law decay, with possibly the same anomaly that the very largest firms have higher values than expected, they have apparently different scaling exponents, equal to 0.39(0.02), 0.51(0.03) and 0.58(0.04). This is in contradiction with Prediction~, which states that their scaling should be {\\it independent} of the moment order q and equal to αμ≈ 0.2. Our evidence suggests in contrast a clear dependence on the order q of the exponent. In fact, the scaling we obtain is close to the one we would observe if the second term in Eq.~, proportional to S^q1μμ, was the dominant term, which is the result expected for a {\\it thintailed} distribution of rescaled volatilities σ/σ(S), i.e. with a tail exponent b > μ, as indeed found above since b ≈ 4.6. Such a thintailed distribution of volatilities would asymptotically lead to exponents 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 for q=2, 3 and 4 respectively. We however expect subdominant corrections coming from the incipient tail contribution to be responsible for the observed discrepancies for q ≲ b (0.51 instead of 0.6 for q=3 and 0.58 instead of 0.8 for q=4).In fact, one predicts an asymptotic behaviour as S^ b β independent of q whenever q > b. These results appear again robust when we test them using the standard deviation to proxy growth volatilities and different samples including only firms with at least 20 growth rates and firms closing their fiscal year in December (cfr. Appendix~).",

Considering Proposition~ is again not trivial, since the use of the asymptotic representations in Eq.~ and requires to work in the very large size region. In fact, it is only in this region that the Normal approximation associated with the CLT is expected to be valid, and where the Levy alphastable regime where g∼ S^β is well separated from the nonuniversal regime where g∼ 1 and the growth rate distribution depends on that of the subunits growth shocks. To make this even more challenging, our results indicate that corrections to the CLT decay slowly, as S^1μ, and that the same is true for the corrections associated with the existence of large firms with only a handful of subunits, which vanishes as S^αβ. Unfortunately, typical datasets contain only a few data points in the large size region, and so we expect finite size corrections to play a significant role in shaping the empirical growth rate distribution.",

Although some discrepancies are observed, the Gaussian Mixture model generates a growth rate distribution in very good agreement with empirical observation both in the central and tail regions. The two procedures we have implemented produce qualitatively equivalent results, and perform significantly better than the one reported in Figure~ (green line). The key difference is that in Figure~, the volatilities used to generate the artificial growth rates were simulated according to σi ∼ Si^β, thus neglecting the heterogeneity associated with a firm's internal structure in terms of number and size of subunits. The resulting Gaussian mixture produces a distribution that is not able to capture the central cusp and the fat tails of its empirical target. With this respect a further remark is in order. If, in the mixing of the Normal random variables, one uses the MIG fitted on the nonrescaled volatilities the corresponding growth rates display a distribution that, contrary to what happens with rescaled volatilities, misses its empirical target. Indeed the shape parameter b of the MIG in this case is found to be 2.35(0.03), significantly lower than 4.62(0.09). This implies a fatter right tail for the volatility distribution inducing fatter tails in the distribution of the growth rates generated as scale mixture of Normals. We have clarified above why the estimate of b with nonrescaled volatilities is likely to be biased due to size heterogeneity. This is reassuring when it comes to the sensitivity and consistency of the argument.",

We then define the corresponding rescaled growth rates ĝit as (gitg̅i)/σit. For consistency, we also apply the {\\it leaveoneout} procedure to the mean growth g̅i.The {\\it leaveoneout} procedure avoids an artificial truncation of the tails, see e.g. .

It is apparent that the rescaling procedure has a significant effect on the shape of the growth rate distribution, smoothing the central cusp and fattening both tails. These remain clearly nonGaussian and subexponential, since they display a positive convexity in a linearlog representation. In the same figure, we report for comparison the distribution we would obtain by rescaling the growth rates with an homogeneous mean and an homogeneous volatility for the entire sample (green line). This shows that the associated reshaping, although still apparent, is significantly less pronounced.

                                    "content": "First, we exploit the fact that in a model where the growth rate gi, computed over a one year time window, is a random variable with a GSE distribution multiplied by a firm specific volatility, then the corresponding growth rates, computed over a larger time span, is obtained as the sum of the random variables gi. If these growth rates are independent and identically distributed, the Central Limit Theorem mechanism comes into play, which should lead to a progressive ''Gaussianization'' of the distribution of the corresponding unmixed growth rates ĝi. Figure~ shows that this is what happens empirically albeit with some intriguing discrepancies. It reports in the left panel the kernel density estimate of the distributions of the rescaled growth rate computed over a 1, 2, 3 and 4 years timespan together with, in the right panel, their GSE fit whose parameters estimates are shown in the bottom panel of Table~. In line with our reasoning, we observe an apparent process of ''Gaussianization'' of the distribution. The size of the Gaussian central region, measured by w, almost double rising from 1.9 to 3.5 when we widen the time window from 1 year to 4 years. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the tails (described by the parameter z) appear to get {\\it fatter} as the timespan increases (see Table~), although the probability mass in that region significantly drops from 9 at 1 year to less than 1 at 4 years. Correspondingly, when comparing the empirical distribution for 2 years, 3 years and 4 years to a numerical convolution of 2, 3 or 4 i.i.d. random variables drawn from the 1 year distribution, we find significant deviations: the tails of empirical distributions are ''too fat'', signalling the existence of persistence effects. In other words, the convolution results suggests that growth rates are autocorrelated even over three and four years, i.e. persistently good or bad periods or persistently volatile periods build up tails that would not exist if the growth process was independent across time.",

Regarding I2, we have that \\begin{equation} \\mathbb{E}\\left[s^{2k2}e^{\\lambda s}\\right]\\mathbb{E}[s^2 e^{\\lambda s}]\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\lambda s}]^{K2} \\approx \\mu^2\\Gamma[2k2\\mu]\\Gamma[2\\mu] e^{\\lambda \\mathbb{E}[s]K}\\lambda^{\\mu2k2}\\lambda^{\\mu2}\\propto \\lambda^{2\\mu2k}, \\end{equation} so that I2 ∼ K^12μ=𝒪(K^1μ). In the end, the dominating contribution is given by I1 for k≥ 1, and so finally \\begin{equation} \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{H}^k] = K^{1\\mu} \\mu \\mathbb{E}[s]^{\\mu}{ \\Gamma[2k\\mu]\\Gamma[\\mu]}{\\Gamma[2k]}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(K^{1\\mu}\\right). \\end{equation}",

Since P(λ,0) is the Laplace transform of the firm size distribution P(S), for sufficiently large S its behavior is described by Equation~. Gathering the terms proportional to λ^αΓ[α+1] and λ^μΓ[μ+1] allows us to find the asymptotic behaviour described above and the relative contributions of each component by identifying the Laplace transforms of powerlaw tails.

                                    "content": "Eq.~ states simply that, conditional on the size S, a tion 1π(S) of firms will be such that S∝ K and will be made up of K≫ 1 subunits. These firms will have growth rates that are the sum of K≫1 subunit growth rates, resulting in a Gaussian density of variance σ^2. The second contribution corresponds to firms with K=𝒪(1), and therefore the central limit theorem does not apply and the distribution is closer to that of the individual subunits' growth rates ηijt. Obtaining the distribution of P(g|S) is in principle possible by integrating directly over the volatility σ with its probability distribution P(σ) which has been discussed above. We proceed instead by studying the distribution P(S,R) introduced above, finding first the distribution of R|S, the absolute size change conditional on size, which will then allow to find the distribution P(g|S). Writing P(S,R)=P(S)P(R|S), using the definitions from~, we have that \\begin{align} \\widehat{P}(\\lambda,q=\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu})&=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S \\int\\dint R~P(S)P(R|S)\\exp(i\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu}R\\lambda S)\\;\\;. \\end{align} Next, we surmise that when P(R|S)=S^1/μL0,μ(RS^1/μ), i.e. when R|S is distributed according to a symmetric Lévy distribution with parameter μ, Equation~ has the same form as that found in Equation~ of Corollary~. Indeed, setting υ=RS^1/μ in we obtain \\begin{align*} \\widehat{P}(\\lambda,q=\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu})&=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\int\\dint \\upsilon~L{0,\\mu}(\\upsilon)\\exp(i\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu}S^{1/\\mu}\\upsilon\\lambda S) &=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\exp(\\lambda S)\\int\\dint \\upsilon~L{0,\\mu}(\\upsilon)\\exp(i\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu}S^{1/\\mu}\\upsilon) \\end{align*} where one notes that the integral in υ is the characteristic function or Fourier transform of a symmetric L\\'evy alphaStable distribution of parameter μ, L0,μ, evaluated at θλ^1/μS^1/μ. This characteristic function behaves as ∫ dυ e^ t υ∝exp(At^1/μ), where A is a constant. Applying this to the equation above leads to: \\begin{align*} \\widehat{P}(\\lambda,q=\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu})&=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\exp(\\lambda S)~\\exp(A\\theta^{\\mu}\\lambda S). \\end{align*} Then \\begin{align*} \\widehat{P}(\\lambda,q=\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu})&=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\int\\dint \\upsilon~L{0,\\mu}(\\upsilon)\\exp(i\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu}S^{1/\\mu}\\upsilon\\lambda S) &=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\exp(\\lambda S)\\int\\dint \\upsilon~L{0,\\mu}(\\upsilon)\\exp(i\\theta\\lambda^{1/\\mu}S^{1/\\mu}\\upsilon) &[the integral in υ is the Fourier transform of L0,μ which has an exponential form] \\nonumber &=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\exp(\\lambda S)~\\exp(A\\theta^{\\mu}\\lambda S) &[where A is a constant] \\nonumber &=\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\exp(\\lambda S (1+A\\theta^{\\mu})) &=1\\int0^{+\\infty}\\dint S~P(S) \\left( 1\\exp(\\lambda S (1+A\\theta^{\\mu}))\\right) &[using twice the linear approximation of e^x∼ x1] &=1\\lambda\\mathbb{E}\\left[S\\right]  A\\theta^{\\mu}\\lambda \\mathbb{E}\\left[S\\right] + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda) &=1\\lambda\\mathbb{E}\\left[S\\right](1+A\\theta^{\\mu}) + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda) \\;\\;, \\end{align*} which indeed matches Equation~. Now, this proves that RS^1/μ is distributed according to a Lévy distribution with parameter μ, and therefore \\begin{equation} P(R|S) \\sim S^{1/\\mu}L{\\mu,0}(RS^{1/\\mu}). \\end{equation} since R=gS and since β=11/μ, this proves the first part of the proposition. The cutoff value at g∼ 1 results from the fact that the Herfindahl has a cutoff at ℋ=1. For the second part, we first write that P(g)=∫ S P(S)P(g|S), and then consider the cumulative density function, P>(g):=∫g^∞ g1 P(g1). This yields \\begin{equation} \\begin{split} P>(g)=& \\intg^\\infty \\dint g1 \\int \\dint S~ P(S) S^{\\beta}L{0,\\mu}(g1 S^\\beta) =& \\int \\dint S~ P(S) S^{\\beta} \\int{g}^\\infty \\dint g1 ~L{0,\\mu}(g1 S^{\\beta}) &(using that asymptotically, L0,μ(x)∼ x^1μ) \\sim& \\int \\dint S~ P(S) S^{\\beta} S^{\\beta(1+\\mu)}\\int{g}^\\infty \\dint g1 g1^{1\\mu} \\sim& g^{\\mu} \\int \\dint S~P(S)S^{\\beta\\mu}\\sim g^{\\mu}, \\end{split} \\end{equation} where we have used the fact that βμ = μ  1 < 1 so that the integral over S is convergent for both small and large S. This shows that P(g) is a mixture of Lévy alphastable distributions with a powerlaw tail with exponent μ.",

This finding has shaped research agendas in a number of fields, including (but not limited to) macroeconomics, industrial organization, labor, and trade. This paper surveys and evaluates recent empirical work addressing the question of why businesses differ in their measured productivity levels. The causes are manifold, and differ depending on the particular setting. They include elements sourced in production practices—and therefore over which producers have some direct control, at least in theory—as well as from producers' external operating environments. After evaluating the current state of knowledge, I lay out what I see are the major questions that research in the area should address going forward.},

abstract = {This paper provides a systematic cross-country investigation of the relation between a firm’s growth volatility and its size. For the first time the analysis is carried out using comparable and representative sets of data sourced by official business registers of an important number of countries. We show that there exists a robust negative relation between growth volatility and size with an average elasticity equal to −0.18. We check the robustness of this result against a number of potential sources of bias and in particular with respect to sectoral disaggregation and against the inclusion of firm age. Our result is consistent with the idea that independently from specific country characteristics there exists a common underlying mechanism driving the elasticity between size and growth volatility. We then propose two mechanisms able to explain our result and we conclude discussing its relevance with respect to the recent literature on granularity.}

A test of the Gibrat’s Law of Proportionate Effect is performed and we find, in line with previous literature, a violation concerning the variance of growth. Using disaggregated data on sub-markets, we are however able to show that this violation can be completely accounted for by a diversification effect, namely a scale relation between the number of sub-markets in which a firm is active and its size. To interpret these findings, we propose a stochastic branching model of firm diversification consistent with a notion of cumulative corporate competences.}",

Growth is the result of idiosyncratic firm productivity improvements, selection of successful firms, and imitation by entrants. Selection tends to improve aggregate productivity at a fast rate if entry and imitation are easy. The empirical phenomenon of Zipf's law can be interpreted to mean that entry costs are high or that imitation is difficult, or both. The small size of entrants indicates that imitation must be difficult. A calibration based on U. S. data suggests that about half of output growth can be attributed to selection. But the implied variance of the combined preference and technology shocks is puzzlingly high.}",

  abstract={The upper tail of the firm size distribution is often assumed to follow a Power Law. Several recent papers, using different estimators and different data sets, conclude that the Zipf Law, in particular, provides a good fit, implying that the fraction of firms with size above a given value is inversely proportional to the value itself. In this article we compare the asymptotic and small sample properties of different methods through which this conclusion has been reached. We find that the family of estimators most widely adopted, based on an OLS regression, is in fact unreliable and basically useless for appropriate inference. This finding raises doubts about previously identified Zipf behavior. Based on extensive numerical analysis, we recommend the adoption of the Hill estimator over any other method when individual observations are available.

abstractNote={Recent evidence suggests that a power-law relationship exists between a firm's size and the variance of its growth rate. The flatness of the relation is regarded as puzzling, in that it suggests that large firms are not much more stable than small firms. It has been suggested that the power-law nature of the relationship reflects the presence of some form of correlation of growth rates across the firm's constituent businesses. Here, it is shown that a model of independent businesses which allows for the fact that these businesses vary in size, as modelled by a simple 'partitions of integers' model, provides a good representation of what is observed empirically.},

volume={79},

DOI={10.3982/ECTA8769},
abstractNote={This paper proposes that idiosyncratic firm-level shocks can explain an important part of aggregate movements and provide a microfoundation for aggregate shocks. Existing research has focused on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that individual firm shocks average out in the aggregate. I show that this argument breaks down if the distribution of firm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 firms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This “granular” hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clarified by looking at the behavior of large firms. This paper's ideas and analytical results may also be useful for thinking about the fluctuations of other economic aggregates, such as exports or the trade balance.},

title={The Network Origins of Aggregate Fluctuations},
volume={80},
ISSN={1468-0262},
DOI={10.3982/ECTA9623},
abstractNote={This paper argues that, in the presence of intersectoral input-output linkages, microeconomic idiosyncratic shocks may lead to aggregate fluctuations. We show that, as the economy becomes more disaggregated, the rate at which aggregate volatility decays is determined by the structure of the network capturing such linkages. Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of “cascade effects” whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the “sparseness” of the input-output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.},

abstractNote={This article analyses whether small, young, and innovating firms have experienced a greater employment growth than other Spanish firms over the period 1990-2000. The study draws upon a sample of 1272 manufacturing firms in which only 967 of the firms survived for the entire ten year period. The analyses test Gibrat's law, both by least squares and by utilizing the procedure proposed by Heckman in which a probit survival equation is first estimated to correct for sample selection bias. Two estimators correcting for selection bias are utilized: one that incorporates the inverse Mill's ratio and the other that employs maximum likelihood methods. All the results reject Gibrat's law and support the proposition that small firms have grown larger. Additionally, the results show that old firms grow less than young ones, and innovating activity - both process and product - is a strong positive factor in the firm's survival and its employment growth.},

abstractNote={According to Gibrat's Law of Proportionate Effect, the growth rate of a given firm is independent of its size at the beginning of the examined period. Aimed at extending this line of investigation, the present paper uses quantile regression techniques to test whether Gibrat's Law holds for new entrants in a given industry: that is for new small firms in the early stage of their life cycle. The main finding is that for some selected industries in Italian manufacturing Gibrat's Law fails to hold in the years immediately following start-up, when smaller firms have to rush in order to achieve a size large enough to enhance their likelihood of survival. Conversely, in subsequent years the patterns of growth of new smaller firms do not differ significantly from those of larger entrants, and the Law therefore cannot be rejected.},

DOI={10.1093/icc/dtr036},
abstractNote={We introduce a new 5-parameter family of distributions, the Asymmetric Exponential Power (AEP), able to cope with asymmetries and leptokurtosis and, at the same time, allowing for a continuous variation from non-normality to normality. We prove that the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimates of the AEP parameters are consistent on the whole parameter space, and when sufﬁciently large values of the shape parameters are considered, they are also asymptotically efﬁcient and normal. We derive the Fisher information matrix for the AEP and we show that it can be continuously extended also to the region of small shape parameters. Through numerical simulations, we ﬁnd that this extension can be used to obtain a reliable value for the errors associated to ML estimates also for samples of relatively small size (100 observations). Moreover we show that around this sample size, the bias associated with ML estimates, although present, becomes negligible. Finally, we present a few empirical investigations, using diverse data from economics and ﬁnance, to compare the performance of AEP with respect to other, commonly used, families of distributions.},

abstractNote={We provide further evidence that markets trend on the medium term (months) and mean-revert on the long term (several years). Our results bolster Black’s intuition that prices tend to be off roughly by a factor of 2, and take years to equilibrate. The story behind these results fits well with the existence of two types of behaviour in financial markets: “chartists”, who act as trend followers, and “fundamentalists”, who set in when the price is clearly out of line. Mean-reversion is a self-correcting mechanism, tempering (albeit only weakly) the exuberance of financial markets.},

abstractNote={Trend and Value are pervasive anomalies, common to all financial markets. We address the problem of their co-existence and interaction within the framework of Heterogeneous Agent Based Models (HABM). More specifically, we extend the Chiarella (1992) model by adding noise traders and a non-linear demand of fundamentalists. We use Bayesian filtering techniques to estimate the model on monthly time series of prices across a variety of asset classes since 1800. The fundamental value is an output of the estimation, and does not require the use of an external pricing model. Our extended model reproduces many empirical observations, including the non-monotonic relation between past trends and future returns. The destabilizing activity of trend-followers leads to a qualitative change of mispricing distribution, from unimodal to bimodal, meaning that some markets tend to be over- (or under-) valued for long periods of time.},

Our results suggest that the data can be described by a scaling approach. Here, we propose models that may lead to some insight into these phenomena. First, we study a model in which the growth rate of a company is aﬀected by a tendency to retain an “optimal” size. That model leads to an exponential distribution of the logarithm of the growth rate in agreement with the empirical results. Then, we study a hierarchical tree-like model of a company that enables us to relate the two parameters of the model to the exponent β, which describes the dependence of the standard deviation of the distribution of growth rates on size. We ﬁnd that β = − ln Π/ ln z, where z deﬁnes the mean branching ratio of the hierarchical tree and Π is the probability that the lower levels follow the policy of higher levels in the hierarchy. We also study the distribution of growth rates of this hierarchical model. We ﬁnd that the distribution is consistent with the exponential form found empirically.},

abstractNote={A SUCCESSFUL theory of corporate growth should include both the external and internal factors that affect the growth of a company1-18. Whereas traditional models emphasize production-related influences such as investment in physical capital and in research and development18, recent models10-20 recognize the equal importance of organizational infrastructure. Unfortunately, no exhaustive empirical account of the growth of companies exists by which these models can be tested. Here we present a broad, phenomenological picture of the dependence of growth on company size, derived from data for all publicly traded US manufacturing companies between 1975 and 1991. We find that, for firms with similar sales, the distribution of annual (logarithmic) growth rates has an exponential form; the spread in the distribution of rates decreases with increasing sales as a power law over seven orders of magnitude. A model wherein the probability of a company's growth depends on its past as well as present sales accounts for the former observation. As the latter observation applies to companies that manufacture products of all kinds, organizational structures common to all firms might well be stronger determinants of growth than production-related factors, which differ for companies producing different goods.},

abstractNote={Will a large economy be stable? Building on Robert May's original argument for large ecosystems, we conjecture that evolutionary and behavioural forces conspire to drive the economy towards marginal stability. We study networks of firms in which inputs for production are not easily substitutable, as in several real-world supply chains. Relying on results from Random Matrix Theory, we argue that such networks generically become dysfunctional when their size increases, when the heterogeneity between firms becomes too strong or when substitutability of their production inputs is reduced. At marginal stability and for large heterogeneities, we find that the distribution of firm sizes develops a power-law tail, as observed empirically. Crises can be triggered by small idiosyncratic shocks, which lead to “avalanches” of defaults characterized by a power-law distribution of total output losses. This scenario would naturally explain the well-known “small shocks, large business cycles” puzzle, as anticipated long ago by Bak, Chen, Scheinkman and Woodford.},

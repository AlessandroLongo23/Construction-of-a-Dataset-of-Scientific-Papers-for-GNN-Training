\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a pioneering approach to explore the source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for video object detection (VOD). Specifically, we developed a novel SFDA method for a one-stage-based detector, YOLOV. The proposed STAR-MT technique significantly improves the performance of the video object detector in adverse image conditions without access to the target domain label or source domain data. Owing to its unsupervised nature, this work can be seamlessly applied to real-world scenarios requiring VOD models. The proposed method could serve as a baseline for future research in unsupervised domain adaptation for video object detection.

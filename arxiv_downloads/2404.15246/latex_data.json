The majority of previous works have developed and compared algorithms for this problem in relatively simple models; in contrast to this, we analyze this problem in a more realistic model that captures many real-world aspects, such as communication costs, synchronization costs, and the hierarchical structure of modern processing architectures. For this we extend the well-established BSP model of parallel computing with non-uniform memory access (NUMA) effects. We then develop a range of new scheduling algorithms to minimize the scheduling cost in this more complex setting: several initialization heuristics, a hill-climbing local search method, and several approaches that formulate (and solve) the scheduling problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We combine these algorithms into a single framework, and conduct experiments on a diverse set of real-world computational DAGs to show that the resulting scheduler significantly outperforms both academic and practical baselines. In particular, even without NUMA effects, our scheduler finds solutions of 24%-44% smaller cost on average than the baselines, and in case of NUMA effects, it achieves up to a factor 2.5\u00d7 improvement compared to the baselines. Finally, we also develop a multilevel scheduling algorithm, which provides up to almost a factor 5\u00d7 improvement in the special case when the problem is dominated by very high communication costs.

Experimental research has developed several scheduling heuristics based on natural ideas such as locality, that generally deliver good empirical results in simpler models; however, these heuristics are completely impervious to the parameters of real-world systems, and hence it is unclear how their performance carries over to more complex models. On the practical side, the parallel computing community has developed more sophisticated models, such as the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) or the LogP model, that capture many aspects of a real-world system; however, due to their complexity, these models have mostly been used for developing and analyzing parallel implementations of concrete computations (i.e.\\ specific DAGs), instead of general computational tasks.

We then develop more advanced scheduling algorithms that take a different approach: instead of making heuristic decisions based on e.g.\\ locality, they consider the actual cost of each solution in our complex model (with all its parameters), and directly optimize for minimizing this cost. In particular, we develop (i) a local search algorithm that iteratively improves a solution by making small modifications to a schedule as long as this decreases its total cost, and (ii) several different ways to model the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), and use an ILP solver to find (sub)schedules of small cost.

However, one significant drawback of BSP is that it assumes a uniform communication cost between any pair of processors. In contrast to this, today's computing architectures very often exhibit a hierarchical structure: each processor has multiple cores, each machine has multiple processors, and maybe multiple machines are connected over a network. This hierarchical structure results in a non-uniform memory access setting, where the cost of sending a piece of data heavily depends on the concrete pair of processing units that communicate: sending a value between two cores on the same processor is relatively low, whereas sending the same data over the highest level of the hierarchy (e.g.\\ over the network) is drastically higher."

Due to this, we also extend the BSP model which such NUMA effects, and further analyze the impact of this in our experiments. The BSP definition above is straightforward to extend to this setting: if the cost \u03bb_p_1, p_2 of communicating a single unit of data is known for each pair of processors (p_1, p_2), then we can simply add \u03bb_p_1, p_2 as a further factor in the formulas defining C_send(p,s) and C_rec(p,s) above. The values \u03bb_p_1, p_2 then become further input parameters of the problem; we can specify them either directly for each pair of processors, or implicitly through a hierarchy. Note that the default case of uniform communication costs corresponds to a choice of \u03bb_p_1, p_2=1 for p_1 \u2260 p_2, and \u03bb_p_1, p_2=0 for p_1 = p_2."

While \\texttt{Cilk} was originally not defined on DAGs, it is easy to adapt to this case. Intuitively, \\texttt{Cilk}  maintains a stack of ready tasks for each processor to work on, and if a processor is idle (its stack is empty), it ``steals'' a subtask from the bottom of a (randomly chosen) other processor's stack.

When scheduling the next node, both \\texttt{BL-EST} and \\textttETF assign the node to the processor that offers the earliest start time, based on previous assignments and necessary communication steps. While \\texttt{BL-EST} always selects the next node based on the longest outgoing path, \\textttETF selects the node with the earliest starting time.  \\item \\texttt{HDagg}: a more recent and more advanced state-of-the-art scheduler is the \\texttt{HDagg} algorithm of Zarebavani et. al. \\cite{hdagg}. \\texttt{HDagg} is presented and analyzed in \\cite{hdagg} for the specific purpose of speeding up SpTRSV computations; however, it is in fact a scheduling algorithm that can be applied to any computational DAG. Moreover, \\texttt{HDagg} considers a very similar scheduling model to ours, sorting the nodes of the DAG into so-called wavefronts (essentially equivalent to supersteps), and minimizing the amount of communication between these wavefronts. Our experiments also show that \\texttt{HDagg} consistently outperforms both \\texttt{BL-EST} and \\textttETF. Due to this, \\texttt{HDagg} is a very fitting baseline for our work from the academic side."

Generally, we only allow assigning a node v to processor p if this is possible without ending the computational phase of the current superstep s, i.e.\\ if we can ensure that all of v's predecessors are already available on p by superstep s (that is, they were either computed on processor p or in an earlier superstep). In case of multiple possible node assignments to a processor, tie-breaking is done with a heuristic that aims to minimize communication costs in the future. Once we cannot assign further nodes to at least half of the processors without a communication requirement, the computation phase of the current superstep is closed, and a next superstep is started.     \\item \\texttt{Source}: A different greedy approach that in each step forms a new superstep from the next layer of source nodes in the DAG. As a preprocessing step in the beginning, the algorithm uses a simple rule to cluster the original source nodes of the DAG. Then in each superstep, it applies a round-robin-based approach to assign the current source nodes to processors, considering the nodes in a decreasing order according to w(v) to ensure the load balancing of work costs between processors. Besides the current source nodes, the algorithm occasionally also adds some of their successors to the current superstep, if this requires no extra communication.     \\item \\texttt{ILPinit}: We also apply an ILP-based initialization heuristic that divides the nodes into smaller batches according to a topological order, and consecutively finds a schedule for each batch separately (given the already-selected partial schedules on previous batches), using an ILP-formulation of the subproblem. This approach also provides good initial schedules, but it requires drastically more running time than the heuristics above."

This formulation captures the entire problem as a single ILP, and hence it requires a very high number of variables. Due to this, even with sophisticated ILP solvers, this approach is only feasible for very small DAGs in practice.     \\item \\texttt{ILPpart}: In order to handle larger DAGs, we develop a partial ILP formulation as a more advanced iterative improvement method. In particular, given a starting BSP schedule and two superstep indices s_1 \u2264 s_2, we define a partial ILP that only reorganizes the supersteps between s_1 and s_2; that is, we only consider nodes v that are currently assigned to one of the supersteps in the interval [s_1,   s_2], and try to reassign these differently to any processor and any superstep in [s_1,   s_2], with the rest of the schedule unchanged. This gives a significantly smaller ILP that essentially only scales with the number of supersteps between s_1 and s_2 and the number of nodes assigned to these supersteps. Given this partial ILP formulation, we can then divide the range of supersteps into disjoint intervals, and then repeatedly use this approach to further polish each part of our schedule.     \\item \\texttt{ILPcs}: We also devise and implement a separate ILP representation for the communication scheduling subproblem, i.e.\\ the scheduling of communication steps \u0393 when \u03c0 and \u03c4 are already fixed. This problem has a significantly smaller degree of freedom, hence the ILP solver can often return reasonably good solutions for it on the entire DAG, even for DAGs of larger size. If we already have a BSP schedule with a specific \u03c0 and \u03c4, we can use this ILP formulation to find a more optimal scheduling of the communication steps, hence resulting in a lower total cost."

Since these kinds of computations typically work with matrices and vectors, there are two natural ways to represent them as computational DAGs. In the coarse-grained representation, each matrix or vector corresponds to (the output of) a single node in our DAG. In the fine-grained representation, we also attempt to capture the internal structure of matrices/vectors: in this case, each nonzero entry in a matrix/vector is represented by (the output of) a separate node in our DAG. An example for the two representations is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:coarse_fine}."

Besides this, we also noted that the ILP solver rarely returns any reasonable solution above 20_ 000 variables: in this case, even the preprocessing heuristics of CBC can exceed an 1-hour time limit. Due to this, we only attempt the naive \\texttt{ILPfull} approach from \\citeDAGBSP in very small DAGs, where the estimated number of ILP variables is below 20_ 000. We point out that this limitation is partially due to the fact that our work uses an open-source ILP solver; with today's more powerful commercial ILP solvers, the same approach could be applied to a significantly higher number of variables."

In particular, Table~\\ref{tab:base} shows the cost reduction with respect to the baselines, separated according to g and P (left), and g and the dataset (right). The table shows that the improvement ranges from 32% to 51% compared to \\texttt{Cilk}, and from 13% to 40% compared to \\texttt{HDagg}. We can observe that the difference between our scheduler and the baselines consistently grows larger with higher g; this is because communication costs become more dominant, but these are not (accurately) considered by the baselines. The same holds for larger P values, since this often result in more data that needs to be communicated in a schedule. As for the size of the dataset, the tables suggest that the improvement compared to \\texttt{Cilk} is mostly unaffected, while the improvement compared to \\texttt{HDagg} becomes smaller for large datasets. This is likely because our schedulers come with a higher time complexity, and hence they do not scale as well as \\texttt{HDagg}; improving this property is a strong candidate for our future work. However, we note that even in this cases, our schedules are still consistently better than those returned by \\texttt{HDagg}."

Even for this larger dataset, our scheduler achieves an improvement ranging from 15% to 41% compared to \\texttt{Cilk}, and a more marginal improvement from 6% to 13% compared to \\texttt{HDagg} (details again in Appendix \\ref{app:exps}).

For instance, in our previous setting for the highest choice of \u0394 =  4, we have seen that our scheduler is notably better than the baselines. However, this is only their relative performance; in fact, both our scheduler and the baselines perform rather poorly in this setting, and even the solutions returned by our scheduler are often barely better (or in several cases, in fact, even worse) than the trivial solution of assigning all nodes to the same processor and superstep. Our multilevel algorithm, on the other hand, is able to find good solutions even in this rather challenging setting, consistently beating this trivial baseline."

For completeness, we also show the improvement values in numerical format in Table \\ref{tab:multi_small}. The figure shows that when communication costs are high (e.g.\\ if we have \u0394=4, or if we only have \u0394=3 but P=16, and hence there are NUMA coefficients as high as \u03bb_1, 16=\u0394^log_2P-1=27 in our binary hierarchy), then the multilevel method is able to considerably outperform our base scheduler. For the highest choice of P and \u0394, the multilevel algorithm finds solutions that on average provide a further factor 2\u00d7 improvement to our base scheduler. Altogether, this amounts to a very significant, almost a factor 5 \u00d7 cost reduction, even compared to \\texttt{HDagg}."

Similarly, if we revisit the setting of Section \\ref{sec:nonnumaexp} without NUMA effects, the multilevel approach provides notably weaker solutions in general than our base scheduler (see Appendix \\ref{app:exps} for details). This suggests that our multilevel method is indeed a specialized tool, which is useful mostly when our problem is dominated by high communication costs. However, we note that our algorithm is a relatively simple implementation of this multilevel scheduling idea; we believe that with some further work, the same approach could become an efficient tool for any choice of parameters."

As such, each of these algorithmic building blocks can be further improved into, or replaced by more sophisticated methods: we could apply e.g.\\ more complex local search techniques that also attempt to escape local mimima, or more efficient ILP formulations for our problems, or more advanced methods for the coarsening and refining phase of the multilevel method. We also point out that our experimental results were achieved with an open-source ILP solver; simply employing one of today's more powerful commercial ILP solvers could already significantly improve these results without any changes to the framework itself."

In particular, the BSP-converted variants of the baseline algorithms, the \\texttt{BSPg} and \\texttt{Source} heuristics, and even \\textttHC assumes such a lazy schedule, whereas the ILP-based methods and \\texttt{HCcs} return a specific, optimized communication schedule. We note that \\texttt{ILPinit} also returns a specific \u0393, but this is replaced by the corresponding lazy schedule in our pipeline, since the algorithm is followed by \\textttHC, which is only designed to work with lazy communication schedules."

If the processor's stack is empty, it selects another processor with a non-empty stack (uniformly at random among these processors), and starts executing the node at the bottom of this stack, also removing the node from the stack.

In case have NUMA effects, we compute the Earliest Start Time (EST) in these baseline algorithms by considering the average coefficient of the communication cost over all pairs of processors, and multiplying c(v) with this number when considering the required communication steps. Note that an extension of the EST computation with NUMA factors would also be possible, to obtain a version of these baselines that is more specialized towards our more realistic model; however, we leave the investigation of this approach to future work."

The algorithm strives to ensure both a balanced workload among processors in a superstep, and a reduced amount of inter-processor communication between the supersteps. For more details of the algorithm, we refer the reader to \\cite{hdagg}. Note that this algorithm was originally developed (and analyzed) for the specific purpose of speeding up SpTRSV computations, i.e.\\ solving sparse linear systems defined by a triangular matrix. However, the method is in fact a general DAG scheduling algorithm that can be applied to any computational DAG; it is even analyzed in \\cite{hdagg} using DAG terminology. That is, after a topological ordering, the adjacency matrix of any DAG becomes lower triangular, and by artificially adding an edge from each node to itself (i.e.\\ setting the main diagonal of the matrix to 1, thus ensuring it is non-singular), we obtain an SpTRSV problem where the dependency DAG derived from the matrix is identical to our original computational DAG.

Even though the output assigns the nodes to supersteps, the algorithm still considers the concrete time step of starting and finishing each task, like in classical schedulers such as \\texttt{Cilk} or \\textttETF; this helps us develop a balanced work cost between the processors in each superstep. When a task is finished, we consider the new tasks v \u2208 V that become ready (i.e.\\ have all of their direct predecessors already finished). If v already has a predecessor on multiple processors in the current superstep, then v is added to a general ready_all set of nodes that only become available for all processors in the next superstep. Otherwise, if v only has predecessors on a single processor p in the current superstep, then v is added to a set ready_p of that processor, signaling that processor p is already allowed to execute v in the current superstep. Whenever a task is finished and some processor p becomes free, they are assigned a new node to execute (based on rules discussed below), if this is still possible without closing the current computation phase, i.e.\\ there are still nodes that have all their direct predecessors on p or in earlier supersteps. When half of the processors become idle (they cannot be assigned new nodes), the computation phase is closed, and a following superstep is started, where all the nodes in ready_all are now available to each processor."

We first attempt to choose from the nodes in ready_p that are only available for p, and if this is empty, we choose from the set ready_all available to all processors. From both sets, we use the same tie-breaking rule that attempts to reduce communication costs, assigning a score metric for each node v in the set, and selecting the node with the highest score. For this score, we consider all direct predecessors u of v, and if either u or one of its direct successors is already assigned to p, then we increase the score of v by c(u)/outdeg(u), where outdeg(u) is the outdegree of u. Intuitively, this can be understood as an estimator for the importance and probability of the fact that we can assign u and all its direct successors to p, thus not having to communicate u at all. If c(u) is high, then sending u results in a higher cost, and thus more important to avoid; if outdeg(u) is small, then there is a higher chance that we can indeed achieve this, hence avoiding a communication. As such, this simple score metric for v aims to estimate our opportunities to save communication costs in the future if we assign v to p."

In each iteration, it essentially assigns all the current source nodes of the DAG to processors in some way to form the next superstep. It then disregards (``removes'') these source nodes (and their outgoing edges) from the DAG to create the next set of source nodes for the next superstep. In each superstep, the nodes are assigned to processors following a round-robin approach. The first superstep is handled in a special way: the initial source nodes are first organized into clusters, joining pairs of nodes when they have a common direct successor, and then these clusters are assigned to processors in a round-robin way. In all other supersteps, no clustering is done; instead, the source nodes are sorted in decreasing order according to their work weight, and then assigned to processors in this order in a round-robin fashion, to avoid accumulating a too large work cost on any of the processors."

Note that this settings already considers the assignments \u03c0 and \u03c4 to be fixed. For each necessary communication step (when v needs to be sent from \u03c0(v) to p), this assignment naturally defines an earliest and latest communication phase when this transfer can happen: the earliest is \u03c4(v), and the latest is (s_0-1) for the first superstep s_0 that assigns a direct successor of v to processor p. Our \\texttt{HCcs} method considers alternative communication schedules with (v, \u03c0(v), p, s) \u2208\u0393 for different possible s \u2208 [\u03c4(v), s_0-1]. As before, in each step, we consider a modification of selecting a different such s for only one of the required communication steps, with the remaining communication steps in \u0393 unchanged. Note that for simplicity, this setting implicitly assumes that the value of v is directly sent to p from the processor \u03c0(v) where it was computed. Similarly to \\textttHC, this hill climbing also uses sorted sets and external pointers to efficiently maintain the send cost and receive cost of each processor in every superstep."

Our preliminary experiments have shown that neither of these two approaches is clearly superior to the other in terms of the final schedule found; however, the second method is much more time-consuming, since there are usually numerous possible modification opportunities to analyze from a given solution. Due to this, we have applied the former, greedy variant of the approach in our experiments."

In this full ILP representation, there is a binary variable \\textsc{comp}_v, p, s to indicate whether node v is computed on processor p in superstep s, and a value \\textsc{pres}_v, p, s to indicate if the value of v is already available on p by the end of (the computational phase of) superstep s. Besides these, the communication steps are represented by binary variables \\textsc{comm}_v,p_1,p_2,s, indicating whether (v, p_1, p_2, s) \u2208\u0393. These variables allow a natural way to express both the validity conditions of BSP model (precedence constraints and valid communication steps) and the elements of the cost functions with auxiliary variables; see \\citeDAGBSP for details. For our \\texttt{ILPfull} method, we implement the representation above, with only minimal changes: we aggregate some of the (originally separate) linear constraints into a single constraint, and we replace the role of the explicit variables \\textsc{pres}_v, p, s by the unused variables \\textsc{comm}_v,p,p,s."

Once again, the assignment defines an earliest superstep \u03c4(v) and a latest superstep (s_0-1) when we can send a value v from \u03c0(v) to p if this is required. Hence for each s \u2208 [\u03c4(v), s_0-1], we define a binary variable \\textsc{comm}_v, p, s to indicate whether the value is communicated in superstep s. Note that similarly to \\texttt{HCcs}, this implicitly assumes that the value of v is always sent from \u03c0(v). Given these variables, the main techniques in the \\texttt{ILPcs} formulation are identical to \\texttt{ILPfull}: we can use the same approach to ensure with linear constraints that the communication costs are measured properly, and that each communications step is indeed scheduled to some superstep."

In \\texttt{ILPpart}, we begin from a given subset of supersteps S_0: we split the BSP supersteps into disjoint intervals (from back to front), and consider the nodes that are currently assigned to the supersteps in S_0 in order to obtain our V_0. We form these intervals iteratively, always growing the current interval until |V_0| \u00b7 |S_0| \u00b7 P^2 exceeds 4_000; this is because the number of variables in the ILP representation is in the magnitude of |V_0| \u00b7 |S_0| \u00b7 P^2, so we use this metric to estimate (and limit) the size of the ILP problem obtained. In contrast to this, in case of \\texttt{ILPinit}, we begin with a topological ordering of the DAG, and always select the next batch of nodes in this ordering as V_0, and set S_0 to cover the next 3 supersteps; once again, the number of nodes in each batch is increased until |V_0| \u00b7 3 \u00b7 P^2 exceeds a given threshold (2_000 in this case)."

Let \\ \u03c0(u)=p_1. Then e.g.\\ if we originally had \u03c0(v)=p_1, but the ILP solver sets \u03c0(v)=p_2, then this results in a newly required communication step; on the other hand, if we originally had \u03c0(v)=p_2, but the ILP solver sets \u03c0(v)=p_1, then a previous communication step becomes unnecessary. Note that these communication steps might either be within the superstep interval S_0, or after S_0. In order to ensure that our superstep formulation only scales with |S_0| (instead of also optimizing communications in supersteps after S_0), we choose to ignore the case when v was originally communicated after S_0: in this case, reassigning v might make this communication step unnecessary, and hence reduce the cost of an h-relation after S_0, but we ignore this potential further gain in the ILP objective. On the other hand, whenever v is sent within S_0, this is easily captured by our formulation via the variables \\textsc{comm}_v,p,p',s. In particular, in the last communication phase of S_0, we only include the variables \\textsc{comm}_v,p,p',s for processors p' that require the value of v after S_0, but for these processors, we also add the constraint that v indeed needs to be present on processor p' by the end of S_0. This ensures that our ILP indeed captures the fact that the reassignment comes with newly required communication steps; however, it limits our flexibility by requiring that these new communication steps need to happen until the end of S_0.     \\item  Some of the nodes v \u2208 V_0 might also have direct predecessors u which are scheduled into supersteps before S_0. Similarly to the case of successors, if v is rescheduled to a different processor, then this might result in newly required communication steps or previous communication steps becoming unnecessary. As before, the ignore the potential gains from removable communication steps that were scheduled before S_0, in order to ensure that our ILP size only scales with |S_0|. Within S_0, these communication steps can once again be captured with variables \\textsc{comm}_u,p_1,p_2,s as before; however, we also need to add such variables for the communication phase of the last superstep before S_0. Furthermore, note that the number of such predecessors u can potentially be even larger than |V_0|, hence if we add these variables without consideration, they could notably increase the size of the ILP. To avoid this problem in practice, we apply two simplifications. On the one hand, note that \u0393 might ensure that the value of predecessor u is already communicated to several processors p_0 before S_0; since u is always present on these processors throughout S_0, we do not the add the variables \\textsc{comm}_u,p_1,p_0,s in this case, and we also disregard the precedence constraint (u,v) for \\textsc{comp}_v, p_0, s (since they are satisfied anyway). On the other hand, as before, we assume that the value of u is directly sent from \u03c0(u) (which is fixed, since u is computed before S_0) to any processor; this removes a factor P from the number of communication variables for u. Finally, note that there may also be predecessors u that have both an out-neighbor v _\u2208 _ V_0 and an out-neighbor u' scheduled after S_0; in this case, if u is originally sent to \u03c0(u') during S_0, then we also need to add the constraint that the value of u must still be present on \u03c0(u') by the end of S_0 in our ILP solution.     \\item In our communication schedule \u0393, we may also have communication steps (v, p_1, p_2, s) where v was computed before S_0, it is only required on p_2 after S_0, but our \u0393 still just happens to schedule it during the interval S_0, even though v has no direct successor in V_0. These communication steps have no direct connection to the assignment of the nodes V_0, but they still contribute to the communication costs in one of the supersteps of S_0. The number of these communication steps can theoretically be as high as \u0398(n); hence if we include them as optimizable options in our ILP formulation, then we may lose the advantage of only scaling with |V_0|. As such, we consider these communication steps fixed: the communication costs they incur appear as a pre-computed constant in the send and receive costs of the appropriate processors in the given supersteps, unaffected by our choice of the assignment for V_0."

In our implementation, we consider the following simple technique: we sort the list of contractable edges in an increasing order according to w(u)+w(v), and we always select from the first 1/3 of this list to ensure that we do not merge nodes with large work weight.

This means that when a scheduling of the coarse DAG sends the value of u to v, and computes the cost of this based on summed weights c(u), then this is only an upper bound on the amount of data that actually has to be communicated."

This task of finding the most favorable coarsening ratio is a very challenging and complex problem on its own; investigating this in detail is far beyond the scope of our paper. For our preliminary experiments to validate the multilevel approach, we simply select two specific rates: we coarsen the DAG to 30% and 15% of its original size, run the multilevel approach for both of these cases, and out of the two schedules obtained this way, we select the one with lower cost as the final output of our multilevel scheduler."

This general question has been studied by multiple works in recent years \\cite{DAGpart, DAH}, but was mostly evaluated as a partitioning problem in itself, rather than analyzed as a tool for scheduling. The work of \\citeSPD, as mentioned before, is an exception to this, which has applied one of these acyclic partitioners to further improve state-of-the-art list schedulers. However, in contrast to our iterative coarsening procedure, this approach applies a final acyclic partitioning; as such, it offers no straightforward way to uncoarsen the DAG gradually, and hence there is no opportunity to execute further refinement steps in a multilevel fashion in this case."

That is, we first project our current schedule (obtained from the solving phase or the previous refinement step) into our current, slightly more uncoarsened DAG: we assign each node to the same processor and same superstep as its contracted counterpart. Note that since the contracted graph was still a DAG, this still produces a valid BSP schedule. However, the newly executed uncontraction steps reveal slightly more of the structure of the original DAG, so we can now fine-tune our schedule towards this. For this, we execute several improvement steps with our local search method (\\textttHC) to obtain a slightly more refined variant of our current schedule on this slightly more coarsified version of the DAG."

In the work of \\citeSPD, CCR was simply defined as the ratio of \u2211_v \u2208 V  c(v) and \u2211_v \u2208 V  w(v). This metric is not straightforward to generalize to our model with significantly more parameters: multiplying the numerator with g and also the average NUMA coefficient \u2211\u03bb_p_1, p_2/P^2 is a rather natural extension, but it is not trivial to include e.g.\\ the effect of the parameter \u2113 in this formula."

However, this difference is only relevant from a theoretical modelling perspective, to emphasize the fact that even if a node v has multiple out-neighbors on another processor p, its output only needs to be sent to p once; due to this, for partitioning problems, it is more adequate to represent the output data of v as a hyperedge, containing v and all its out-neighbors. For our work, this is simply an alternative representation of the precedence constraints in the DAG, and hence it has no effect. In fact, all of our algorithms begin with the simple step of transforming these hyperDAGs back into a regular DAG representation."

As such, for simplicity, we assign w(v)=indeg(v)-1 to each node v of the DAG, where indeg(v) is the indegree of v: since the operation v represents combining indeg(v) distinct values, indeg(v)-1 is a reasonable estimation for the workload this requires (consider e.g.\\ a summation or a multiplication). The only exception to this is the source nodes of the DAG, where instead of setting w(v)=0, we still assign a work cost of w(v)=1: while they correspond to inputs of the computation, loading or initializing these values might still require some computational resources. As for communication weights, we uniformly assign a weight of c(v)=1 to all nodes in the coarse-grained DAG. We leave it to potential future work to develop a way to assign more accurate weights to the nodes in these extracted DAGs."

In particular, the best schedule was returned by \\texttt{BSPg} in 44 cases, by \\texttt{Source} in 20 cases and by \\texttt{ILPinit} in 26 cases. Furthermore, we can observe that the relative performance of the heuristics show a strong dependence on the properties of the scheduling problem itself; in particular, on the size of the DAG, the number of processors P, and besides these, also on the ``shape'' of the DAG: the shallow DAGs produced by spmv computations behave rather differently from the rest of the fine-grained DAGs."

Table \\ref{tab:training_spmv} is separated according to P, while Table \\ref{tab:training_rest} is separated according to P and n. There are several straightforward observations from these tables. On the one hand, it is clear that \\texttt{Source} is rather effective for the shallow spmv DAGs, but not very useful otherwise. \\texttt{ILPinit} performs well either for very small DAGs, or for very small P. Finally, \\texttt{BSPg} consistently delivers good results for most of the parameter combinations."

For completeness, here we provide a table with the respective improvements for each combination of P, g and dataset, shown in Table \\ref{tab:main_app}. Note that each number in the \\texttt{tiny}, \\texttt{small}, \\texttt{medium} and \\texttt{large} rows is still the average of 16, 24, 21 and 21 runs on different DAGs, respectively. This more detailed table reveals some further details compared to Table \\ref{tab:base}; for instance, while the cost reduction generally increases with larger P, this in fact only holds for the larger datasets, and the effect is in fact the opposite for the \\texttt{tiny} DAGs. It also shows that for the most extreme subcase, our scheduler achieves almost a factor 2\u00d7 improvement with respect to \\texttt{HDagg}, and well over a factor 2\u00d7 improvement with respect to \\texttt{Cilk}, even in this non-NUMA setting."

The \\texttt{ILPpart} column shows the relative cost of the schedule after running \\texttt{ILPfull} and \\texttt{ILPpart}, whereas \\texttt{ILPcs} shows the final schedule after also running \\texttt{ILPcs}. The table shows that in the \\texttt{tiny} dataset, \\texttt{ILPfull}/\\texttt{ILPpart} has a significant effect, decreasing the mean ratio from 0.619 to 0.569, which amounts to a 8% cost decrease from 0.619. As n grows larger, the improvement achieved by these methods becomes less significant. In contrast to this, \\texttt{ILPcs} only achieves a minimal improvement on the smaller dataset, but it is more impressive when n is larger: it decreases the ratio from 0.529 to 0.506 on \\texttt{medium} and from 0.542 to 0.521 on \\texttt{large} (4% improvement in both cases). This suggests that \\texttt{ILPpart} and \\texttt{ILPcs} excel in different situations, and hence they are both valuable ingredients in our scheduler."

We investigate different values for the latency in this setting: \u2113 _\u2208 _{ 2, 5, 10, 20}."

Similarly, we only considered g_=_1, since with P_=_16 and \u0394_=_4, this already gives a coefficient as high as \u0394^3_=_64 between pairs of processors that are only connected over the highest level of the hierarchy. As before, we set \u2113_=_5. For the NUMA multiplier, we consider the values \u0394 _\u2208 _{ 2, 3, 4}. Generally, as n grows larger, the improvement with respect to \\texttt{HDagg} typically get smaller, whereas the improvement with respect to \\texttt{Cilk} does not show such a clear pattern in terms of n."

This shows that the initializers achieve a 15%, 22% and 32% cost reduction compared to \\texttt{Cilk} (for P=4,  8,   16, respectively). The local search methods then further improve this by 7%, 8% and 10% (for P=4,  8,   16, respectively) compared to \\texttt{Init}. Hence even for these much larger DAGs, without applying our ILP-based methods, our schedulers achieve a rather significant improvement to \\texttt{Cilk}, especially for higher P values. When compared to \\texttt{HDagg}, we see that \\texttt{Init} is approximately on par with this baseline, and altogether, \\texttt{Init}+\\textttHC+\\texttt{HCcs} provides an improvement of 11%, 7% and 11% (for P=4,  8,   16, respectively). We leave it to future work to improve the scaling of our algorithms, to ensure that they are also superior to \\texttt{HDagg} by a more significant margin for DAGs of this size."

The improvement here ranges from 30% to 48% compared to \\texttt{Cilk}, and 7% to 21% compared to \\texttt{HDagg}. As such, similarly to the smaller dataset, the improvements become larger when we have NUMA effects; however, the difference between our scheduler and \\texttt{HDagg} still remains relatively small in several of the cases."

In particular, when we have high NUMA costs in our model, it can happen in our experiments that the best solution found by both the baseline methods and our scheduler is in fact more costly than the trivial solution of assigning the entire DAG to a single processor and single superstep. This clearly shows that the schedulers (both the baselines and ours) fail to find any reasonable schedule in this case. In particular, with very high communication cost parameters, it is not even clear at first whether a solution of lower cost even exists (just not found by our schedulers), or whether the trivial solution mentioned above is in fact the optimal schedule in these problems."

In particular, over all experiments with NUMA costs (P _\u2208 _{ 8, 16}, \u0394 _\u2208 _{ 2, 3, 4}), there were as many as 114 out of 396 cases where our base scheduler (and the baselines) could not find a solution with lower than trivial cost; however, with the application of the multilevel algorithm, the number of such cases was only 8 out of 396. These numbers are understood over all datasets except \\texttt{tiny} (where multilevel scheduling was not applied, and hence it cannot be included in this comparison). This shows that even our relatively simple implementation of this multilevel idea can indeed very nicely fill the specialist role of scheduling these kind of problems."

The tables show that compared to the baselines, the multilevel approach can achieve a cost reduction of up to 87% and 79% in the most extreme case (with respect to \\texttt{Cilk}/\\texttt{HDagg}), which is more than a factor 7.7\u00d7 improvement from \\texttt{Cilk} and more than a factor 4.7\u00d7 from \\texttt{HDagg}. When compared to our base scheduling framework, the multilevel approach clearly remains inferior when \u0394_=_2, it is approximately equally strong when \u0394_=_2 and P_=_8, and is clearly superior when we have \u0394_=_3 and P_=_16, or \u0394_=_4.

This was already indicated before by the case of \u0394_=_2 in Table \\ref{tab:ml2}. In our setting without NUMA, the difference is even larger: for instance, the mean ratio of the multilevel algorithm to our base scheduler is 1.246 for a choice of P_=_8 and g_=_3, and 1.515 for a choice of P_=_16 and g_=_1 (still understood over all datasets except \\texttt{tiny}). While these ratios imply that the multilevel approach is still somewhat better than \\texttt{Cilk} (and even marginally better than \\texttt{HDagg} in the P_=_8, g_=_3 case), altogether, it is clearly inferior to our base scheduler. This suggests that our current implementation of the multilevel method can indeed be understood as a specialized tool for the case when communication costs are really dominant in the scheduling problem."

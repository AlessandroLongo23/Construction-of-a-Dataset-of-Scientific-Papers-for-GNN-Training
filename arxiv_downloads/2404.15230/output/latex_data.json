Notable developments in the study of the tree property pertain to obtaining the tree property simultaneously on long intervals of cardinals, and this area of research requires analyses of variants of Mitchell's forcing. In this spirit, Kruger raised the question of whether these properties could be separated for successive cardinals, or even an infinite sequence of cardinals . We studied the case in which internally stationary is distinguished from internally club by using forcings that accomplish the work of mixed support iterations while more explicitly resembling Mitchell's forcing .",

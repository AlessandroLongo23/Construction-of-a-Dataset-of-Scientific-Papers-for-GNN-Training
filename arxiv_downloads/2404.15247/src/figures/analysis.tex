\caption{Proportion of tokens assigned to each expert on different programming languages from \multiple (including Python) for layers 0, 11, and 23. The shared expert 0 is excluded from the chart because all the tokens are always assigned to it. The gray vertical line marks $\frac{1}{7}$, which is the proportion expected with the uniform sampling.}

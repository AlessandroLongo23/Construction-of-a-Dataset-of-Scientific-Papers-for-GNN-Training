\section*{Limitations}
While \ours has proven to be effective through extensive experiments in the paper, we apply our technique to \llm{s} with no more than 3B parameters due to resource constraints. This limitation hinders our ability to showcase the impact of \ours on larger models. In addition, to balance the general knowledge in the shared expert and the specific knowledge in other normal experts, we introduce a hyperparameter $\lambda$ in the merging process of \ours, which might slightly increase the efforts for hyperparameter search. It would be interesting to explore other hyperparameter-free techniques to tackle this challenge in the future. Furthermore, while \ours has been empirically proven powerful, it would be interesting to provide a theoretical explanation for its strong performance.

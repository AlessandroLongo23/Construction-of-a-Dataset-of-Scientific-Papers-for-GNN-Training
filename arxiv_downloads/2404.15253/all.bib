abstract="This chapter is dedicated to mean-square (strong) numerical methods for SDEs. It starts with the classical fundamental theorem which establishes the mean-square order of convergence of a method using assumptions on properties of its one-step approximation only. Then, the stochastic Taylor expansion is used for constructing Taylor-type methods. Many mean-square schemes are presented. They include explicit, drift-implicit, balanced and fully implicit schemes. Some Runge-Kutta type methods are also given. All schemes are accompanied by their convergence analysis. Numerical methods suitable for approximating SDEs with nonglobally Lipschitz conditions are discussed in a separate section which also includes a version of the fundamental convergence theorem under some relaxed assumptions. SDEs with additive and colored noise are met very often in applications and hence they are of great independent interest. Efficient high-order methods because of special properties of such systems are given. The wish to construct a large amount of methods is related to the fact that distinct methods have various properties as regards their accuracy, stability, time and computational cost, etc. The chapter also covers such aspects as almost sure convergence, exact and approximate modeling of Ito integrals depending on single or several noises, and A-stability of numerical methods for stiff systems of SDEs with additive noise."

	Abstract = {We have used the ring polymer molecular-dynamics method to study the translational and orientational motions in an extended simple point charge model of liquid water under ambient conditions. We find, in agreement with previous studies, that quantum-mechanical effects increase the self-diffusion coefficient D and decrease the relaxation times around the principal axes of the water molecule by a factor of around 1.5. These results are consistent with a simple Stokes-Einstein picture of the molecular motion and suggest that the main effect of the quantum fluctuations is to decrease the viscosity of the liquid by about a third. We then go on to consider the system-size scaling of the calculated self-diffusion coefficient and show that an appropriate extrapolation to the limit of infinite system size increases D by a further factor of around 1.3 over the value obtained from a simulation of a system containing 216 water molecules. These findings are discussed in light of the widespread use of classical molecul...},

	Abstract = {We propose an approximate method for calculating Kubo-transformed real-time correlation functions involving position-dependent operators, based on path integral (Parrinello-Rahman) molecular dynamics. The method gives the exact quantum mechanical correlation function at time zero, exactly satisfies the quantum mechanical detailed balance condition, and for correlation functions of the form C̃Ax(t) and C̃xB(t) it gives the exact result for a harmonic potential. It also works reasonably well at short times for more general potentials and correlation functions, as we illustrate with some example calculations. The method provides a consistent improvement over purely classical molecular dynamics that is most apparent in the low-temperature regime.},

@article{Craig2005,
	Abstract = {We show how the ring-polymer molecular dynamics method can be adapted to calculate approximate Kubo-transformed flux-side correlation functions, and hence rate coefficients for condensed phase reactions. An application of the method to the standard model for a chemical reaction in solution---a quartic double-well potential linearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators---is found to give results of comparable accuracy to those of the classical Wigner model and the centroid molecular dynamics method. However, since the present method does not require that one evaluate the Wigner transform of a thermal flux operator or that one perform a separate path integral calculation for each molecular dynamics time step, we believe it will prove easier to apply to more general problems than either of these alternative techniques. We also present a (logarithmic) discretization scheme for the Ohmic bath in the system-bath model that gives converged results with just nine bath modes---a surprisingly small number for a mode...},

@article{Craig2005a,
	Abstract = {We further develop the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method for calculating chemical reaction rates [I. R. Craig and D. E. Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 084106 (2005)]. We begin by showing how the rate coefficient we obtained before can be calculated in a more efficient way by considering the side functions of the ring-polymer centroids, rather than averaging over the side functions of the individual ring-polymer beads. This has two distinct advantages. First, the statistics of the phase-space average over the ring-polymer coordinates and momenta are greatly improved. Second, the resulting flux-side correlation function converges to its long-time limit much more rapidly. Indeed the short-time limit of this flux-side correlation function already provides a ``quantum transition state theory'' approximation to the final rate coefficient. In cases where transition state recrossing effects are negligible, and the transition state dividing surface is put in the right place, the RPMD rate is therefore...},

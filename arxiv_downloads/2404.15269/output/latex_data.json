            "content": "We study interactive learning of language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE, to conduct PREference Learning from User's Direct Edits by inferring a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data and using it to define a prompt policy that drives future response generation. This avoids finetuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex, subtle, and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER (Consolidates Induced Preferences based on Historical Edits with Retrieval). CIPHER~leverages a large language model (LLM) to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER~retrieves inferred preferences from the kclosest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments  summarization and email writing, for evaluation using a GPT4 simulated user. We compare with algorithms that directly retrieve user edits but do not learn descriptive preference, and algorithms that learn contextagnostic preference. On both tasks,~CIPHER~outperforms baselines by achieving the lowest edit distance cost. Meanwhile,~CIPHER~has a lower computational expense, as using learned preference results in a shorter prompt than directly using user edits. Our further analysis reports that the user preference learned by~CIPHER~shows significant similarity to the ground truth latent preference.Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/gaog/prelude.\\looseness=1",

The example in~\\pref{fig:main} illustrates that the user directly edits the summary generated by the agent to satisfy their preference on bullet point format. It takes time and efforts for the user to make edits. We can measure such cost using a variety of metrics, such as the edit distance between the agentgenerated response and the userrevised text. Zero edit from the user is also a useful feedback, reflecting that the agent's response satisfies this user's needs. One important feature of our setting is that every natural use of the agent yields an edit feedback for learning. Since there is no distinction between training and testing in this setting, we care about minimizing the user's efforts across all rounds of interaction with the agent. In summary, our goal is to learn from the implicit feedback in user edit history to minimize the cumulative cost of the user's efforts.\\looseness=1",

These preference descriptions are different from the notion of comparisonbased preference used in RLHF. In this paper, we use the word preference to mean preference descriptions. For instance, preference of the user in~\\pref{fig:main} can be described as bullet points. In practice, user preference can be compound, such as preferring bullet point, informal, with emojis at the same time, and also contextdependent, e.g., informal tone when writing an email to a family member, and formal tone when writing to a colleague. In more complex settings, user preference can evolve with time (nonstationary), or depend on information unavailable in the context (partially observed). Such user preference may not be fully derivable from the context, and the user may not even be fully aware of all their preference. These considerations imply that user preference is latent to the language agent. If the agent could learn the latent preference correctly, it can significantly improve its performance by generating satisfactory responses accordingly. Furthermore, preference learned by the agent can be shown to the user to enhance interpretability, and can even be modified by the user to improve correctness. Motivated by this, we propose a learning framework, PRELUDE (PREference Learning from User's Direct Edits), where we seek to learn a textual description of the user preference for a given context using the history of user edits.",

For a given context,~CIPHER~first retrieves the kclosest contexts from history, and aggregates inferred preferences for these k contexts. It relies on this aggregate preference to generate a response for the given context. If the user performs no edits, then it saves this aggregate preference as the correct preference for the given context. Otherwise, it queries the LLM to infer a plausible preference that explains these user edits made to the agent response, and saves this inferred preference as the correct preference for the given context. A key advantage of~CIPHER~is that it typically leads to significantly shorter prompts compared to other retrieval methods that use the entire documents or context, as inferred preferences are much shorter than retrieved documents or contexts.

In the first task, we evaluate the agent's ability to summarize a given document. We use documents from 5 existing sources listed in~\\pref{tab:latentuserpref}. in Appendix provides links to each source dataset, used as userprovided context in our tasks. These sources represent a diverse category of documents that a writing assistant would typically encounter, including news articles that are formal and concise, movie reviews that are informal, and paper abstracts that are technical. In the second task, we evaluate the agent's ability to compose an email given notes. For this task, we use notes from four different sources including a variety of tasks such as writing emails to friends, describing reports to managers, and writing reviews for colleagues. In any given round, the user is provided a context that is a document from one of the document sources for the given task. Importantly, the agent is unaware of the source of the given document which as we discuss later, will determine the user preference. For both tasks, we run an experiment for T = 200 rounds, with an equal number of randomly sampled documents from each document source. We mix documents from different sources and shuffle them to remove any temporal correlation in document source across rounds.\\looseness=1",

We define a set of latent user preferences for the user that vary based on the document source.~\\pref{tab:latentuserpref} lists the preference and the corresponding document source. This captures the contextdependent nature of user preferences as the document source influences the type of context. For example, the Personal problem document source contains documents pertaining to discussions with a friend, and a user may have a different preference when writing an email to a friend compared to writing an email to a colleague. In realworld settings, the context dependence of the user preference can be more complex than just the document source. We assume that our user is aware of the document source dt of a given context xt. This implies, that we can express the true user preference for xt as f^⋆t = F(dt) where F maps a given document source to the user preference. Recall that the agent in our learning setup is never provided the document source of any context.",

Our main metric is the cumulative user edit cost ∑t=1^T ct over T rounds. In any given round, we compute the user edit cost ct = Δedit(yt, y't) using Levenshtein edit distance between agent response yt and user edits y't. To compute the edit distance, we perform BPE tokenization using Tiktoken tokenizer, and compute the edit distance in the token space. In general, one can learn a metric that better captures the cognitive load associated with a user edit. However, Levenshtein edit distance provides a clean, transparent metric that is easy to interpret. Additionally, it doesn't have concerns shared by learned metrics such as erroneous evaluations when applying the metric to examples not covered by the metric's training distribution.",

It then creates an ICL prompt containing these k examples where yzℓ is presented as the input, and y'zℓ is presented as the desired output. The agent then uses the context xt and the ICL prompt to generate the response. This approach doesn't infer preferences but must instead use the user edit data directly to align to the given user preference. However, unlike explorethenexploit LPI and Continual LPI, this approach can perform contextdependent learning as the generated response attends on both the given context xt and the historical data.",

As Levenshtein distance Δedit(yt, y't) is upper bounded by max|yt|, |y't|, therefore, the normalized cost is at most 1. \\pref{fig:normalizedcost}~reports normalized cost over rounds for the top 3 methods. We notice that for all variants of~CIPHER~for the summarization task, and for~CIPHER5M for the email writing task, the normalized cost decreases notably as training progresses indicating learning.

This feedback, tailored to each example, is often utilized to rank candidate outputs, thereby improving task performance. Some work studies learning from text feedback to generate outputs directly, by generating multiple refinements of the original output based on the feedback and finetuning the original model to maximize the likelihood of the best refinement. In grounded settings such as instructionbased navigation, one line of work has also used hindsight feedback that explicitly provides a text instruction for the generated trajectory, to train policies. Moving beyond the conventional focus on text feedback that explicitly articulates human intent, we investigate feedback in the form of direct edits on the original model output. Such revisions by users occur naturally during model deployment in practice. Additionally, we examine the learning of user preferences through historical interactions, aiming to surpass the constraints of examplespecific feedback.",

Since these LLMbased assistants are often used by individuals, a natural question has arisen on how to personalize these agents for each user. Straightforward approaches for finetuning LLMs includes supervised learning, online DPO, learningtosearch, and reinforcement learning. These approaches can be directly applied to our setting. For example, one can use (yt, y't) in~\\pref{proto:learningfromedits} as the preference data where y't is preferred over yt, or use y't as the ground truth for supervised learning. However, finetuning is expensive and hard to scale with the number of users. Therefore, a line of work has explored improving the alignment of frozen LLMs by prompt engineering, such as learning a personalized retrieval model, learning a prompt policy given a reward function, or more generally, learning to rewrite the entire prompt. We focus on learning a prompt policy by learning from user edits, and specifically, using them to extract textural descriptions of user preference.\\looseness=1",

We conjecture that user edits are driven by a latent user preference that can be captured by textual descriptions. We introduce the~PRELUDE~framework that focuses on learning descriptions of user preferences from user edit data and then generating an agent response accordingly. We propose a simple yet effective retrievalbased algorithm~CIPHER~that infers user preference by querying the LLM, retrieves relevant examples in the history, and aggregates induced preferences in retrieved examples to generate a response for the given context. We introduce two interactive environments with a GPT4 simulated user to study learning from edits, which can be of independent interest. In this work, we focus on aligning an LLM agent with a frozen LLM, in part, due to the challenge of scaling finetuning based approaches with the number of users. However, for settings where computational cost is not a barrier, applying finetuning approaches would be an interesting future work direction. Another promising future work direction is to learn user preference based on different levels of edits  words, sentences, paragraphs  to generate a satisfactory response.\\looseness=1 \\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}",

The authors present a new model that differs from most existing methods, which typically use language models for stutter identification. Instead, their model is based on acoustic features, which allows it to identify various kinds of stuttering disfluencies without relying on speech recognition technology. The proposed model combines a deep residual network with bidirectional long shortterm memory (LSTM) layers to classify different stutter types. It has been shown to significantly outperform current leading methods, reducing the average miss rate to 10.03%, which is a 27% improvement over the stateoftheart. & (tweet style, simple English, inquisitive, skillful foreshadowing, with emojis) \\marginparNEWline Ever struggled with stuttering or know someone who does? \\includegraphics[height=10pt]{graphs/speaker.png} Research on detecting stutters hasn't been huge, but guess what?

This is most common for news articles and Reddit posts, for which the user shows nuanced preference for several aspects. & The dominant missing aspect is brief or short sentences across different context, although the agent can infer keywords such as concise. For news article context, the agent tends to infer the preference keyword whimsical. The agent has difficulty to infer subtle aspects, including invoke personal reflection, immersive, positive, parallel structure, inquisitive, and skillful foreshadowing.\\vspace{5pt} & 2) Sometimes fail to infer some important aspects, even though the user edits clearly show such preference. & The agent often could not infer secondperson narrative. For question answering style, the agent occasionally only learns consistent format. \\midrule Consolidation of induced preferences from retrieved interactions (f̃t) & Overall, this step can capture the majority preference relatively well, although it tends to result in a more general preference compared to the retrieved ones. & When both specific phrase secondperson narrative and general phrase narrative or narration occur in retrieved examples, the agent often chooses to give a final preference not including the secondperson perspective aspect. \\midrule Retrieval of historical examples relevant to the given context & The retrieval part in general works reasonably well, with more than half of the retrieved example being truly relevant to the given context. Note that one incorrect retrieved example typically does not affect the performance, as we instruct the agent to only use the most represented preference keywords among all five retrieved examples. & The agent sometimes retrieves wrong examples for Wikipedia context when its topic very relates to other context, e.g. wrongly retrieving past examples on news articles and movie reviews when the topic in the given Wikipedia context relates to these domains. \\bottomrule",

  \emph{Dependency pairs}
    are one of the most powerful techniques for proving
    termination of term rewrite systems (TRSs), and they are used in almost all
    tools for termination analysis of TRSs.
    Problem \#106 of the RTA List of Open Problems asks for an adaption of
    dependency pairs for \emph{relative termination}. 
    Here, infinite rewrite sequences are allowed, but one wants to prove that a certain
    subset of the rewrite
    rules cannot be used infinitely often.
    Dependency pairs were recently adapted to 
    \emph{annotated dependency pairs (ADPs)} to prove almost-sure termination of probabilistic TRSs. 
    In this paper, we develop a novel adaption of ADPs for relative
    termination.
    We implemented our new ADP framework in our tool \aprove{} and
    evaluate it in comparison to 
    state-of-the-art tools for relative termination of TRSs.

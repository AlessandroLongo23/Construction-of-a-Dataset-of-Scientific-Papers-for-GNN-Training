            "content": "This paper delves into the distressing prevalence of genderbased violence (GBV) and its deepseated psychological ramifications, particularly among Muslim South Asian women living in diasporic communities. Despite the gravity of GBV, these women often face formidable barriers in voicing their experiences and accessing support. \"Augmented Voices\" emerges as a technological beacon, harnessing the potential of augmented reality (AR) to bridge the digital and physical realms through mobile devices, enhancing the visibility of these oftensilenced voices. With its technological motivation firmly anchored in the convergence of AR and realworld interactions, \"Augmented Voices\" offers a digital platform where storytelling acts as a catalyst, bringing to the fore the experiences shared by these women. By superimposing their narratives onto physical locations via Geographic Information System (GIS) Mapping, the application \"augments their voices\" in the diaspora, providing a conduit for expression and solidarity. This project, currently at its developmental stage, aspires to elevate the stories of GBV victims to a level where their struggles are not just heard but felt, forging a powerful connection between the user and the narrative. \"Augmented Voices\" is designed to transcend the limitations of conventional storytelling, creating an \"augmented\" reality where voices that are often muted by societal constraints can resonate powerfully. Through this intimate and immersive engagement, the project underscores the urgent imperative to confront GBV, catalyzing societal transformation and fostering robust support networks for those in the margins. The project is a pioneering example of how technology can become a formidable ally in the fight for social justice and the empowerment of the oppressed. Additionally, this paper delves into the nuanced AR workflow of \"Augmented Voices,\" illustrating its relevance and contribution to the broader theme of sitespecific AR for social justice.",

When I want to tell him that I didn't break things intentionally, my tongue gets paralyzed and I can't speak a word—it's all the fear, I think it's better to die once than dying every day\" .

Through its innovative use of AR to create immersive, geolocated storytelling experiences, this project transcends traditional educational methods, providing users with a deeply personal and empathetic insight into the realities of social injustice and inequality. By enabling users to not only consume but also contribute to the narrative landscape through the addition of their own stories, \"Augmented Voices\" democratizes the storytelling process, ensuring a diverse and authentic representation of experiences. This participatory element enriches the project's narrative tapestry and fosters a community of engaged and informed advocates for social change.",

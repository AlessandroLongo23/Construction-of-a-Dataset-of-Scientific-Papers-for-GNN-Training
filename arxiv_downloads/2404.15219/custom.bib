	abstract = {Large language models can perform semantic parsing with little training data, when prompted with in-context examples. It has been shown that this can be improved by formulating the problem as paraphrasing into canonical utterances, which casts the underlying meaning representation into a controlled natural language-like representation. Intuitively, such models can more easily output canonical utterances as they are closer to the natural language used for pre-training. Recently, models also pre-trained on code, like OpenAI Codex, have risen in prominence. For semantic parsing tasks where we map natural language into code, such models may prove more adept at it. In this paper, we test this hypothesis and find that Codex performs better on such tasks than equivalent GPT-3 models. We evaluate on Overnight and SMCalFlow and find that unlike GPT-3, Codex performs similarly when targeting meaning representations directly, perhaps because meaning representations are structured similar to code in these datasets.},

We release several strong baseline models, demonstrating performance improvements over a vanilla BERT architecture and state-of-the-art results on 5 out of 7 tasks, by pre-training on a large open-domain dialogue corpus and task-adaptive self-supervised training.

	abstract = {Collecting and annotating task-oriented dialogues is time-consuming and costly. Thus, zero and few shot learning for dialogue tasks presents an exciting opportunity. In this work, we propose an in-context (IC) learning framework for zero-shot and few-shot learning dialogue state tracking (DST), where a large pretrained language model (LM) takes a test instance and a few exemplars as input, and directly decodes the dialogue state without any parameter updates. This approach is more flexible and scalable than prior DST work when adapting to new domains and scenarios. To better leverage a tabular domain description in the LM prompt, we reformulate DST into a text-to-SQL problem. We also propose a novel approach to retrieve annotated dialogues as exemplars. Empirical results on MultiWOZ show that our method IC-DST substantially outperforms previous fine-tuned state-of-the-art models in few-shot settings. In addition, we test IC-DST in zero-shot settings, in which the model only takes a fixed task instruction as input, finding that it outperforms previous zero-shot methods by a large margin on MultiWOZ.},

This work introduces MultiWOZ 2.4, which refines the annotations in the validation set and test set of MultiWOZ 2.1. The annotations in the training set remain unchanged (same as MultiWOZ 2.1) to elicit robust and noise-resilient model training.

Though immensely useful and one of the largest resources of its kind to-date, MultiWOZ 2.0 has a few shortcomings. Firstly, there are substantial noise in the dialogue state annotations and dialogue utterances which negatively impact the performance of state-tracking models. Secondly, follow-up work (Lee et al., 2019) has augmented the original dataset with user dialogue acts. This leads to multiple co-existent versions of the same dataset with minor modifications. In this work we tackle the aforementioned issues by introducing MultiWOZ 2.1. To fix the noisy state annotations, we use crowdsourced workers to re-annotate state and utterances based on the original utterances in the dataset. This correction process results in changes to over 32\% of state annotations across 40\% of the dialogue turns. In addition, we fix 146 dialogue utterances by canonicalizing slot values in the utterances to the values in the dataset ontology. To address the second problem, we combined the contributions of the follow-up works into MultiWOZ 2.1. Hence, our dataset also includes user dialogue acts as well as multiple slot descriptions per dialogue state slot. We then benchmark a number of state-of-the-art dialogue state tracking models on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset and show the joint state tracking performance on the corrected state annotations. We are publicly releasing MultiWOZ 2.1 to the community, hoping that this dataset resource will allow for more effective models across various dialogue subproblems to be built in the future.},

However, most current approaches have difficulty scaling to larger, more complex dialogue domains. This is due to their dependency on either: a) Spoken Language Understanding models that require large amounts of annotated training data; or b) hand-crafted lexicons for capturing some of the linguistic variation in users{'} language. We propose a novel Neural Belief Tracking (NBT) framework which overcomes these problems by building on recent advances in representation learning. NBT models reason over pre-trained word vectors, learning to compose them into distributed representations of user utterances and dialogue context. Our evaluation on two datasets shows that this approach surpasses past limitations, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models which rely on hand-crafted semantic lexicons and outperforming them when such lexicons are not provided.",

In this paper, we address a practical DST problem that is rarely discussed, i.e., learning efficiently with limited labeled data. We present and investigate two self-supervised objectives: preserving latent consistency and modeling conversational behavior. We encourage a DST model to have consistent latent distributions given a perturbed input, making it more robust to an unseen scenario. We also add an auxiliary utterance generation task, modeling a potential correlation between conversational behavior and dialogue states. The experimental results show that our proposed self-supervised signals can improve joint goal accuracy by 8.95\% when only 1\% labeled data is used on the MultiWOZ dataset. We can achieve an additional 1.76\% improvement if some unlabeled data is jointly trained as semi-supervised learning.

In this paper, we propose a Schema-guided multi-domain dialogue State Tracker with graph attention networks (SST) that predicts dialogue states from dialogue utterances and schema graphs which contain slot relations in edges. We also introduce a graph attention matching network to fuse information from utterances and graphs, and a recurrent graph attention network to control state updating.

BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.},

Significant manual effort and domain knowledge is required to design effective prompts, limiting the generalizability of these approaches to new domains and tasks.

This correction process results in changes to over 32\% of state annotations across 40\% of the dialogue turns. In addition, we fix 146 dialogue utterances by canonicalizing slot values in the utterances to the values in the dataset ontology. To address the second problem, we combined the contributions of the follow-up works into MultiWOZ 2.1. Hence, our dataset also includes user dialogue acts as well as multiple slot descriptions per dialogue state slot. We then benchmark a number of state-of-the-art dialogue state tracking models on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset and show the joint state tracking performance on the corrected state annotations. We are publicly releasing MultiWOZ 2.1 to the community, hoping that this dataset resource will allow for more effective models across various dialogue subproblems to be built in the future.},

	abstract = {MultiWOZ is a well-known task-oriented dialogue dataset containing over 10,000 annotated dialogues spanning 8 domains. It is extensively used as a benchmark for dialogue state tracking. However, recent works have reported presence of substantial noise in the dialogue state annotations. MultiWOZ 2.1 identified and fixed many of these erroneous annotations and user utterances, resulting in an improved version of this dataset. This work introduces MultiWOZ 2.2, which is a yet another improved version of this dataset. Firstly, we identify and fix dialogue state annotation errors across 17.3\% of the utterances on top of MultiWOZ 2.1. Secondly, we redefine the ontology by disallowing vocabularies of slots with a large number of possible values (e.g., restaurant name, time of booking). In addition, we introduce slot span annotations for these slots to standardize them across recent models, which previously used custom string matching heuristics to generate them. We also benchmark a few state of the art dialogue state tracking models on the corrected dataset to facilitate comparison for future work. In the end, we discuss best practices for dialogue data collection that can help avoid annotation errors.},

The counter-intuitive empirical observation is that even though the use of likelihood as training objective leads to high quality models for a broad range of language understanding tasks, using likelihood as a decoding objective leads to text that is bland and strangely repetitive. In this paper, we reveal surprising distributional differences between human text and machine text. In addition, we find that decoding strategies alone can dramatically effect the quality of machine text, even when generated from exactly the same neural language model. Our findings motivate Nucleus Sampling, a simple but effective method to draw the best out of neural generation. By sampling text from the dynamic nucleus of the probability distribution, which allows for diversity while effectively truncating the less reliable tail of the distribution, the resulting text better demonstrates the quality of human text, yielding enhanced diversity without sacrificing fluency and coherence.},

	abstract = {BERT adopts masked language modeling (MLM) for pre-training and is one of the most successful pre-training models. Since BERT neglects dependency among predicted tokens, XLNet introduces permuted language modeling (PLM) for pre-training to address this problem. However, XLNet does not leverage the full position information of a sentence and thus suffers from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MPNet, a novel pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT), and takes auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full sentence and thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in XLNet). We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale dataset (over 160GB text corpora) and fine-tune on a variety of down-streaming tasks (GLUE, SQuAD, etc). Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin, and achieves better results on these tasks compared with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods (e.g., BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa) under the same model setting. The code and the pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/microsoft/MPNet.},

Dialogue state annotations are error-prone, leading to sub-optimal performance. Various efforts have been put in rectifying the annotation errors presented in the original MultiWOZ dataset. In this paper, we introduce MultiWOZ 2.3, in which we differentiate incorrect annotations in dialogue acts from dialogue states, identifying a lack of co-reference when publishing the updated dataset. To ensure consistency between dialogue acts and dialogue states, we implement co-reference features and unify annotations of dialogue acts and dialogue states. We update the state of the art performance of natural language understanding and dialogue state tracking on MultiWOZ 2.3, where the results show significant improvements than on previous versions of MultiWOZ datasets (2.0-2.2).},

The prevalence of large language models advances the state-of-the-art for program synthesis, though limited training resources and data impede open access to such models. To democratize this, we train and release a family of large language models up to 16.1B parameters, called CODEGEN, on natural language and programming language data, and open source the training library JAXFORMER. We show the utility of the trained model by demonstrating that it is competitive with the previous state-of-the-art on zero-shot Python code generation on HumanEval. We further investigate the multi-step paradigm for program synthesis, where a single program is factorized into multiple prompts specifying subproblems. To this end, we construct an open benchmark, Multi-Turn Programming Benchmark (MTPB), consisting of 115 diverse problem sets that are factorized into multi-turn prompts. Our analysis on MTPB shows that the same intent provided to CODEGEN in multi-turn fashion significantly improves program synthesis over that provided as a single turn. We make the training library JAXFORMER and model checkpoints available as open source contribution: https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen.},

Taking inspiration from large-scale question sets used in natural language processing research, we authored one thousand English-language questions that directly assess commonsense causal reasoning, called the Choice Of Plausible Alternatives (COPA) evaluation. Using a forcedchoice format, each question gives a premise and two plausible causes or effects, where the correct choice is the alternative that is more plausible than the other. This paper describes the authoring methodology that we used to develop a validated question set with sufficient breadth to advance open-domain commonsense reasoning research. We discuss the design decisions made during the authoring process, and explain how these decisions will affect the design of high-scoring systems. We also present the performance of multiple baseline approaches that use statistical natural language processing techniques, establishing initial benchmarks for future systems.},

Despite its success, we found that the empirical results of GPT-3 depend heavily on the choice of in-context examples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective strategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random sampling) that better leverage GPT-3{'}s in-context learning capabilities.Inspired by the recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment neural networks, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar to a test query sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative inputs to unleash GPT-3{'}s power of text generation. We evaluate the proposed approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks, where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms the random selection baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders fine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results. Notably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-to-text generation (44.3{\%} on the ToTTo dataset) and open-domain question answering (45.5{\%} on the NQ dataset).",

In this setup, models are typically prompted with demonstrations that are similar to the input question. However, in the setup of compositional generalization, where models are tested on outputs with structures that are absent from the training set, selecting similar demonstrations is insufficient, as often no example will be similar enough to the input. In this work, we propose a method to select diverse demonstrations that aims to collectively cover all of the structures required in the output program, in order to encourage the model to generalize to new structures from these demonstrations. We empirically show that combining diverse demonstrations with in-context learning substantially improves performance across three compositional generalization semantic parsing datasets in the pure in-context learning setup and when combined with finetuning.},

Traditional methods usually adopt a supervised paradigm to learn DST from a manually labeled corpus. However, the annotation of the corpus is costly, time-consuming, and cannot cover a wide range of domains in the real world. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-span prediction network (MSPN) that performs unsupervised DST for end-to-end task-oriented dialogue. Specifically, MSPN contains a novel split-merge copy mechanism that captures long-term dependencies in dialogues to automatically extract multiple text spans as keywords. Based on these keywords, MSPN uses a semantic distance based clustering approach to obtain the values of each slot. In addition, we propose an ontology-based reinforcement learning approach, which employs the values of each slot to train MSPN to generate relevant values. Experimental results on single-domain and multi-domain task-oriented dialogue datasets show that MSPN achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements. Besides, we construct a new Chinese dialogue dataset MeDial in the low-resource medical domain, which further demonstrates the adaptability of MSPN.},

    abstract = "In task-oriented dialogs (TOD), reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms train a model to directly optimize response for task-related metrics. However, RL often needs to perform exploration, which can be time-consuming due to the slow auto-regressive sequence generation process. We investigate an approach to create a more efficient RL-based algorithm to improve TOD performance in an offline setting. First, we use a faster generation procedure that samples from independent next-word distributions after training the language model (LM) with supervised learning. We then introduce a fine-grained reward function to help the model focus on learning key information in a dialog, by measuring the importance and semantic closeness of each generated token. Experiments on the MultiWoZ dataset show our new training algorithm, Keywords Reinforcement Learning with Next-word Sampling (KRLS), achieves state-of-the-art performance on the end-to-end response generation task, with a 15{\%} training time reduction compared to a standard RL algorithm using auto-regressive generation.",

Utilizing the predefined task schema, i.e., belief instruction and dialog policy, we instruct fixed LLMs to generate appropriate responses on novel tasks, without the need for training data. Specifically, SGP-TOD comprises three components: an LLM for interacting with users, a Dialog State Tracking (DST) Prompter to aid the LLM in tracking dialog states with the given belief instruction, and a Policy Prompter to direct the LLM to generate proper responses adhering to the provided dialog policy. Experimental results on Multiwoz, RADDLE, and STAR datasets show that our training-free strategy, SGP-TOD, yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot performance, significantly surpassing the few-shot approaches. In a domain-extension setting, SGP-TOD aptly adapts to new functionalities by merely adding supplementary schema rules. We make our code and data publicly available.",

  abstract = 	 {GPT-3 can perform numerous tasks when provided a natural language prompt that contains a few training examples. We show that this type of few-shot learning can be unstable: the choice of prompt format, training examples, and even the order of the examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance to near state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that this instability arises from the bias of language models towards predicting certain answers, e.g., those that are placed near the end of the prompt or are common in the pre-training data. To mitigate this, we first estimate the model’s bias towards each answer by asking for its prediction when given a training prompt and a content-free test input such as "N/A". We then fit calibration parameters that cause the prediction for this input to be uniform across answers. On a diverse set of tasks, this contextual calibration procedure substantially improves GPT-3 and GPT-2’s accuracy (up to 30.0% absolute) across different choices of the prompt, while also making learning considerably more stable.}

For example, they can perform multiple choice tasks simply by conditioning on a question and selecting the answer with the highest probability. However, ranking by string probability can be problematic due to surface form competition-wherein different surface forms compete for probability mass, even if they represent the same underlying concept, e.g. "computer" and "PC." Since probability mass is finite, this lowers the probability of the correct answer, due to competition from other strings that are valid answers (but not one of the multiple choice options). We introduce Domain Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information, an alternative scoring function that directly compensates for surface form competition by simply reweighing each option according to a term that is proportional to its a priori likelihood within the context of the specific zero-shot task. It achieves consistent gains in zero-shot performance over both calibrated (Zhao et al., 2021) and uncalibrated scoring functions on all GPT-2 and GPT-3 models over a variety of multiple choice datasets.},

the principled incorporation of large pretrained models for the response prior.
We present extensive experiments showing that a noisy channel model decodes
better responses compared to direct decoding and that a two-stage pretraining
strategy, employing both open-domain and task-oriented dialogue data, improves
over randomly initialized models.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in learning from explanations in prompts. Yet, there has been limited understanding of what makes explanations effective for in-context learning. This work aims to better understand the mechanisms by which explanations are used for in-context learning. We first study the impact of two different factors on prompting performance when using explanations: the computation trace (the way the solution is decomposed) and the natural language of the prompt. By perturbing explanations on three controlled tasks, we show that both factors contribute to the effectiveness of explanations, indicating that LLMs do faithfully follow the explanations to some extent. We further study how to form maximally effective sets of explanations for solving a given test query. We find that LLMs can benefit from the complementarity of the explanation set as they are able to fuse different reasoning specified by individual exemplars in prompts. Additionally, having relevant exemplars also contributes to more effective prompts. Therefore, we propose a maximal-marginal-relevance-based exemplar selection approach for constructing exemplar sets that are both relevant as well as complementary, which successfully improves the in-context learning performance across three real-world tasks on multiple LLMs.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

	abstract = {The task of dialogue generation aims to automatically provide responses given previous utterances. Tracking dialogue states is an important ingredient in dialogue generation for estimating users' intention. However, the {\textbackslash}emph\{expensive nature of state labeling\} and the {\textbackslash}emph\{weak interpretability\} make the dialogue state tracking a challenging problem for both task-oriented and non-task-oriented dialogue generation: For generating responses in task-oriented dialogues, state tracking is usually learned from manually annotated corpora, where the human annotation is expensive for training; for generating responses in non-task-oriented dialogues, most of existing work neglects the explicit state tracking due to the unlimited number of dialogue states. In this paper, we propose the {\textbackslash}emph\{semi-supervised explicit dialogue state tracker\} (SEDST) for neural dialogue generation. To this end, our approach has two core ingredients: {\textbackslash}emph\{CopyFlowNet\} and {\textbackslash}emph\{posterior regularization\}. Specifically, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture, named {\textbackslash}emph\{CopyFlowNet\}, to represent an explicit dialogue state with a probabilistic distribution over the vocabulary space. To optimize the training procedure, we apply a posterior regularization strategy to integrate indirect supervision. Extensive experiments conducted on both task-oriented and non-task-oriented dialogue corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Moreover, we find that our proposed semi-supervised dialogue state tracker achieves a comparable performance as state-of-the-art supervised learning baselines in state tracking procedure.},

	abstract = {Recently, two approaches, fine-tuning large pre-trained language models and variational training, have attracted significant interests, separately, for semi-supervised end-to-end task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems. In this paper, we propose Variational Latent-State GPT model (VLS-GPT), which is the first to combine the strengths of the two approaches. Among many options of models, we propose the generative model and the inference model for variational learning of the end-to-end TOD system, both as auto-regressive language models based on GPT-2, which can be further trained over a mix of labeled and unlabeled dialog data in a semi-supervised manner. Variational training of VLS-GPT is both statistically and computationally more challenging than previous variational learning works for sequential latent variable models, which use turn-level first-order Markovian. The inference model in VLS-GPT is non-Markovian due to the use of the Transformer architecture. In this work, we establish Recursive Monte Carlo Approximation (RMCA) to the variational objective with non-Markovian inference model and prove its unbiasedness. Further, we develop the computational strategy of sampling-then-forward-computation to realize RMCA, which successfully overcomes the memory explosion issue of using GPT in variational learning and speeds up training. Semi-supervised TOD experiments are conducted on two benchmark multi-domain datasets of different languages - MultiWOZ2.1 and CrossWOZ. VLS-GPT is shown to significantly outperform both supervised-only and semi-supervised self-training baselines.},

We propose the Variational Hierarchical Dialog Autoencoder (VHDA) for modeling the complete aspects of goal-oriented dialogs, including linguistic features and underlying structured annotations, namely speaker information, dialog acts, and goals. The proposed architecture is designed to model each aspect of goal-oriented dialogs using inter-connected latent variables and learns to generate coherent goal-oriented dialogs from the latent spaces. To overcome training issues that arise from training complex variational models, we propose appropriate training strategies. Experiments on various dialog datasets show that our model improves the downstream dialog trackers' robustness via generative data augmentation. We also discover additional benefits of our unified approach to modeling goal-oriented dialogs – dialog response generation and user simulation, where our model outperforms previous strong baselines.},

	abstract = {Recent methods for knowledge grounded dialogs generate responses by incorporating information from an external textual document. These methods do not require the exact document to be known during training and rely on the use of a retrieval system to fetch relevant documents from a large index. The documents used to generate the responses are modeled as latent variables whose prior probabilities need to be estimated. Models such as RAG , marginalize the document probabilities over the documents retrieved from the index to define the log likelihood loss function which is optimized end-to-end. In this paper, we develop a variational approach to the above technique wherein, we instead maximize the Evidence Lower bound (ELBO). Using a collection of three publicly available open-conversation datasets, we demonstrate how the posterior distribution, that has information from the ground-truth response, allows for a better approximation of the objective function during training. To overcome the challenges associated with sampling over a large knowledge collection, we develop an efficient approach to approximate the ELBO. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to apply variational training for open-scale unsupervised knowledge grounded dialog systems.},

Traditional methods ﬁnd dialogue states by manually labeling training corpora, upon which neural models are trained. However, the labeling process can be costly, slow, error-prone, and more importantly, cannot cover the vast range of domains in real-world dialogues for customer service. We propose the task of dialogue state induction, building two neural latent variable models that mine dialogue states automatically from unlabeled customer service dialogue records. Results show that the models can effectively ﬁnd meaningful dialogue states. In addition, equipped with induced dialogue states, a state-ofthe-art dialogue system gives better performance compared with not using a dialogue state module.},

	abstract = {Recently, Transformer based pretrained language models (PLMs), such as GPT2 and T5, have been leveraged to build generative task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems. A drawback of existing PLM-based models is their non-Markov architectures across turns, i.e., the whole history is used as the conditioning input at each turn. First, this brings inefficiencies in memory and computation. Furthermore, using the whole history increases model complexity and may hurt the training efficiency, especially when facing small amounts of labeled training data (the low-resource setting). In this paper, motivated by the observation that dialog states could be viewed as Markov states, we propose to build Markovian Generative Architectures (MGA) over PLM backbones for efficient TOD systems. Experiments on MultiWOZ2.1 show that in the rich-resource setting, the proposed Markov models reduce memory and time costs without performance degradation; in the low-resource setting, the training efficiency of the Markov models is more significant.},

With the help of a large dialog corpus (Reddit), we pre-train the model using the following 4 tasks, used in training language models (LMs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) literature: 1) masked language model; 2) response generation; 3) bag-of-words prediction; and 4) KL divergence reduction. We also add additional parameters to model the turn structure in dialogs to improve the performance of the pre-trained model. We conduct experiments on PersonaChat, DailyDialog, and DSTC7-AVSD benchmarks for response generation. Experimental results show that our model achieves the new state-of-the-art results on all these datasets.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

However, training belief trackers often requires expensive turn-level annotations of every user utterance. In this paper we aim at alleviating the reliance on belief state labels in building end-to-end dialog systems, by leveraging unlabeled dialog data towards semi-supervised learning. We propose a probabilistic dialog model, called the LAtent BElief State (LABES) model, where belief states are represented as discrete latent variables and jointly modeled with system responses given user inputs. Such latent variable modeling enables us to develop semi-supervised learning under the principled variational learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce LABES-S2S, which is a copy-augmented Seq2Seq model instantiation of LABES. In supervised experiments, LABES-S2S obtains strong results on three benchmark datasets of different scales. In utilizing unlabeled dialog data, semi-supervised LABES-S2S significantly outperforms both supervised-only and semi-supervised baselines. Remarkably, we can reduce the annotation demands to 50\% without performance loss on MultiWOZ.},

            "content": " The Kernel-Free Boundary Integral (KFBI) method presents an iterative solution to boundary integral equations arising from elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). This method effectively addresses elliptic PDEs on irregular domains, including the modified Helmholtz, Stokes, and elasticity equations. The rapid evolution of neural networks and deep learning has invigorated the exploration of numerical PDEs. An increasing interest is observed in deep learning approaches that seamlessly integrate mathematical principles for investigating numerical PDEs. We propose a hybrid KFBI method, integrating the foundational principles of the KFBI method with the capabilities of deep learning. This approach, within the framework of the boundary integral method, designs a network to approximate the solution operator for the corresponding integral equations by mapping the parameters, inhomogeneous terms and boundary information of PDEs to the boundary density functions, which can be regarded as the solution of the integral equations. The models are trained using data generated by the Cartesian grid-based KFBI algorithm, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. It accurately predicts density functions across diverse boundary conditions and parameters within the same class of equations. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained model can directly infer the boundary density function with satisfactory precision, obviating the need for iterative steps in solving boundary integral equations. Furthermore, applying the inference results of the model as initial values for iterations is also reasonable; this approach can retain the inherent second-order accuracy of the KFBI method while accelerating the traditional KFBI approach by reducing about 50\\% iterations.

Originating in the boundary integral method, the KFBI method not only retains the favourable conditioning of the boundary integral equation but also obviates the direct computation of Green's function, which is notably complex in irregular domains \\cite{xie2019fourth, ying2013kernel}.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly utilized for solving PDEs, circumventing the explicit discretization requirement, and learning mappings in specific spaces favorable for discovering solutions to PDEs. Simultaneously, DNN-based methods demonstrate efficacy in mitigating the curse of dimensionality and prove beneficial in addressing certain inverse problems. Various neural network architectures, loss functions, and activation functions have been explored for this purpose. For instance, the deep Galerkin method (DGM) \\cite{sirignano2018dgm} and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) \\cite{raissi2019physics} employ equation residuals as loss functions within a general framework for PDE resolution. These networks are refined through stochastic gradient descent, applying spatial point random sampling within the domain. Implement of conditions is achieved by network integration \\cite{berg2018unified} or loss penalization, with the latter relying on penalty coefficients as hyper-parameters. However, the fine-tuning of these coefficients is a complex process necessitating further methodical investigation. A recently proposed boundary integral network (BINet) \\cite{CSIAM-AM-4-275} presented a convolution representation of the solutions to elliptic PDEs using Green's functions. This approach was subsequently extended to a method for discovering general Green's functions, which can be acquired through training neural networks \\cite{lin2023bi}."

Recent studies have introduced the concept of learning mesh-free, infinite-dimensional operators using neural networks \\cite{li2021fourier,lulu2021deeponet,Bhattacharya2021,Nelsen2021,Patel2021}. These neural operators, capable of resolving a class of PDEs rather than specific instances, allow evaluations at arbitrary temporal and spatial points. As an example, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is proposed in \\cite{li2021fourier}, utilizing Fourier transformation for network architecture design. For DeepONet proposed in \\cite{lulu2021deeponet}, a network structure comprising branch and trunk nets is introduced, addressing PDE parameters and spatial coordinates, respectively. Additionally, Deep Green \\cite{Gin2021} and MOD-net \\cite{CiCP-32-299} employ neural networks to approximate Green's function, effectively representing the solution operator for nonlinear PDEs by mapping source terms or boundary values to solutions."

Note the meanings of \\(I\\), \\(J\\), and \\(M\\) will be consistently employed throughout the subsequent sections of this paper. To better integrate with the standard KFBI method, a natural and effective approach for operator learning is to set the input and output of the neural network to be the values of g_D and \u03c6 at the M points on the closed curve \u2202\u03a9, respectively, when using network \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \u03a9 to approximate the operator \ud835\udcae_\u2112, \u03a9.

Considering the difficulties posed by arbitrarily closed curves are incalculable, a more common approach is considering a class of parametric curves. Specifically, \ud835\udcae_\u2112 can be considered as a solution operator for equation 1/2\u03c6+\ud835\udca6\u03c6 =  g_D (caused by the fixed operator \u2112) on a class of \u2202\u03a9, which is mapping (\u2202\u03a9, g_D) to the density \u03c6. Thus, we aspire for a neural network \ud835\udca9_\u2112, that can simultaneously intake boundary position information of \u2202\u03a9 and values about the function g_D, yielding output values about density \u03c6. Denote by {\ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc22} _i = 1^M the point set in the KFBI method which are used to discrete the boundary \u2202\u03a9. Recall that in the previous network \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \u03a9, we configured the input of this network as (g_D(\ud835\udc31_1), g_D(\ud835\udc31_2), ..., g_D(\ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc0c))^T and the output as (\u03c6(\ud835\udc31_1), \u03c6(\ud835\udc31_2), ..., \u03c6(\ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc0c))^T. Returning to the discussion about network \ud835\udca9_\u2112, the required input should be divided into two parts. One component consists of the values of the function g_D, which remains consistent with the above, while the other component should incorporate spatial location information yielded by a class of boundary, such as ellipses with different major and minor axes. Here, we propose two methods for incorporating boundary position information into the network. One approach is to directly incorporate the positional coordinates into the network, that is, setting the network's input as (\ud835\udc31_1, \ud835\udc31_2, ..., \ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc0c)^T and (g_D(\ud835\udc31_1), g_D(\ud835\udc31_2), ..., g_D(\ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc0c))^T, where \ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc22 = (x_i, 1, x_i, 2)^T is the coordinate for all i = 1, 2, ..., N. Another approach involves adding only the parameters of the boundary curve to the network's input. For instance, the ellipses with parameters of axial lengths r_a, r_b can be defined as \u2202\u03a9_{r_a, r_b} := {(x, y): (x - x_0)^2/r_a^2 + (y - y_0)^2/r_b^2 = 1}, here x_0 and y_0 are constant numbers. Then the input of the network \ud835\udca9_\u2112 can be designed as (r_a, r_b)^T and (g_D(\ud835\udc31_1), g_D(\ud835\udc31_2), ..., g_D(\ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc0c))^T. While it is true that various methods can be suggested, these two approaches have been observed to be effective and computationally efficient in subsequent numerical experiments, especially the first approach that was able to include more information."

For fixed operator \u2112 and domain \u03a9, an exact solution to equation \\eqref{one_GPU:PDE} can be constructed, and the KFBI method can be executed based on the inhomogeneous term f and boundary condition g_D derived from this exact solution. This process yields a pair (g_D, \u03c6), assuming the KFBI method's minor error is negligible. Specifically, pairs (g_D(\ud835\udc31_1), ..., g_D(\ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc0c))^T and (\u03c6(\ud835\udc31_1), ..., \u03c6(\ud835\udc31_\ud835\udc0c))^T are obtained from each exact solution. To train the linear neural network \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \u03a9 effectively, more than M linearly independent vectors g_D should be added to the dataset. Consequently, constructing over M exact solutions for equation \\eqref{one_GPU:PDE} to obtain corresponding sets of g_D and \u03c6 becomes necessary. Typically, M can be chosen as a power of 2, like 128, 256, 512, etc. In general, to get a more generalized model, we will make the size of the data set much larger than M although a training data set with M linearly independent pairs is enough due to the linearity of real operators and the networks. For instance, several thousand pairs of g_D and \u03c6 are enough to train the model when M = 128."

The networks are designed to infer the density function \u03c6. Consequently, the inference results from these neural networks can be directly utilized as density functions \u03c6, which are then integrated into the formula \\eqref{One_GPU:fredholm_dirichlet}. Solving the corresponding interface problem \\eqref{one_GPU:interface} yields the solution to the PDE \\eqref{one_GPU:PDE}. Alternatively, the output \u03c6 from the neural networks can be used as the initial value in the iterative KFBI method, reducing the number of iterations and saving time. These approaches are subsequently referred to as Strategies 1 and 2, respectively.

Being quite radical, the first method effectively reduces the KFBI method's iteration count to one, thereby considerably decreasing the running time, though at some cost to precision (relative to the KFBI method). However, as will be demonstrated in subsequent numerical experiments, this approach still achieves reasonably good numerical accuracy. The second method offers a balanced approach, acting as a preprocessing solution for setting the initial value in the KFBI iterative process. This method reduces a portion of the iteration count without compromising precision (relative to the KFBI method). Both methods are proven feasible and valuable through the upcoming numerical experiments. Additionally, due to the relatively simple architecture of the neural network, the time required for a single inference is negligible. \\item The operator learning approach based on the KFBI method, as proposed in this work, effectively reduces the problem's dimensionality. When addressing equation \\eqref{one_GPU:PDE} for d=2, the input and output of the operator \ud835\udcae_\u2112, \u03a9 (or \ud835\udcae_\u2112, \ud835\udcae_\u03a9), approximated by the neural network \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \u03a9 (or \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \ud835\udca9_\u03a9), are functions on a one-dimensional manifold, and thus are naturally represented by vectors with M components. This aspect of the method significantly aids in solving elliptic PDEs on \u03a9 by learning mappings between functions defined on \\(\\partial \\Omega\\), highlighting a significant advantage of the approach.  \\item The training of the neural network \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \u03a9 enables the solution of a wide range of equations \\eqref{one_GPU:PDE}, where both the non-homogeneous term f and boundary conditions g_D can vary. The applicability of neural networks \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \ud835\udca9_\u03a9 and \ud835\udca9 is further extended, demonstrating their powerful range, which stands as another distinctive feature of this method. These models are pivotal in solving PDEs, as evidenced in Section \\ref{Numerical Experiments}.  \\item The proposed method can be synergistically combined with other techniques, such as multigrid solvers and GPU acceleration, to enhance solution efficiency."

This equation's solution (\ud835\udc2e, p) is expressible in terms of volume and boundary integrals, involving the density function \u03c6, which solves the corresponding boundary integral equation. The right-hand side of this boundary integral equation is denoted as \\(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{g_D}}\\). Terms such as \ud835\udcae_\u2112, \u03a9 (or \ud835\udcae_\u2112, \ud835\udcae_\u03a9) and \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \u03a9 (or \ud835\udca9_\u2112, \ud835\udca9_\u03a9) retain their previous meanings. Notably, \ud835\udc20_\ud835\udc03 becomes a vector function \\((\\widetilde{g_D}^{(1)},\\widetilde{g_D}^{(2)})\\), and a similar transformation applies to \\(\\mathbf{\\varphi}\\). However, this does not introduce complications in the network's construction and training, as a tensor of size (M, 2) can be conveniently reshaped into a vector of length 2M. For this example, the absolute tolerance for iteration is set at 1E-8, and the initial value in the standard KFBI is \u03c6_0 = (0, 0)^T."

When employing Strategy 1, we achieve high-precision numerical solutions. Moreover, timing experiments indicate that the time required to solve the equation on grids of size 128\u00d7128, 256\u00d7256, 512 \u00d7 512 and 1024 \u00d7 1024 using Strategy 1 is merely 0.1280s, 0.3862s, 1.650s and 6.103s, respectively. This leads to a substantial reduction in computation time, approximately 90\\%! On the other hand, when employing Strategy 2, we can reduce the running time by almost half without compromising precision compared to the standard KFBI method."

The domain \u03a9 is designated a dumbbell-shaped area, as depicted in figure \\ref{fig:Modified Helmholtz}. Specifically, \u2202\u03a9 is a periodic C^2 cubic spline curve, passing through control points detailed in Appendix \\ref{appen:Control Points for Dumbbel-Shaped Domain}. The coefficient \u03ba, ranging between 1 and 5, is integrated into the input part of the networks. The bounding box \u212c for the interface problem is established as \u212c = [-1.2,1.2] \u00d7 [-1.2,1.2]. The number of discrete points along the boundary curve M is set at M = 92, with I = J = 256 in this example. The absolute tolerance for iteration is fixed at 1E-8, and the initial value for the standard KFBI method is set as \u03c6_0 = (0, 0)^T."

For varying \u03ba values, Strategy 1 enables the achievement of satisfactory precision. Furthermore, the application of Strategy 2 significantly reduces the iteration time of the KFBI method. Notably, due to the domain's shape in this example, the iteration count for the standard KFBI method is considerably higher than in previous cases. However, the models outperform through both Strategy 1 and Strategy 2. Particularly with Strategy 1, corresponding to only about 1.2 iterations (involving one network inference and a single call to the interface problem solver), the method saves over 97% of iteration time compared to the standard KFBI method, which requires over 50 iterations."

Specifically, beyond varying the parameter \u03ba within the range [0.5, 3.0], the computational domain \u03a9 can also undergo transformations involving rotation by an angle \u03b1 and scaling by a factor r relative to the original domain \u03a9_0. Here, the boundary of domain \u03a9_0 is similarly obtained through cubic spline interpolation of a set of control points (which is recorded in Appendix \\ref{appen:Control Points for Dumbbel-Shaped Domain} for details), and \u03b1\u2208 [0, 2 \u03c0], r \u2208 [0.6, 1]. In this case, both \u03ba and the coordinates of \u2202\u03a9 along with the values of g_D at M  discrete points are the input of the network model. The number of discrete points along the boundary curve M is set at M = 46, with I = J = 128 in this example. The absolute tolerance for iteration is fixed at 1E-6, and the initial value for the standard KFBI method is set as \u03c6_0 = (0, 0)^T. Other details correspond to the experiments in \\ref{Modified Helmholtz Equations}."

We allow for perturbations to be applied to certain control points, and incorporate the coordinates of these control points into the input of the model (note that \u2202\u03a9 is obtained through cubic spline interpolation of the control points). Specifically in this experience, the original domain is a heart-shaped domain whose boundary is obtained through cubic spline interpolation of 28 control points, identical to the boundary described in \\ref{Naiver Equations}. We allow for perturbations in the x-direction of the 1st, 14th, and 27th control points, with distances of \u03f5_1, \u03f5_14, \u03f5_27, respectively. Here \u03f5_i \u2208 [-0.15, 0.15], i \u2208{1, 14, 27}. As previously mentioned, the coordinates of these three points will be included in the model's input along with the values of \ud835\udc20_\ud835\udc03 at M  discrete points. The equation parameters E and \u03bd are fixed at 1E9 and 0.45, respectively. The bounding box \u212c for the interface problem is established as \u212c = [-1.5,1.5] \u00d7 [-1.5,1.5]. The number of discrete points on the boundary curve M is set at M = max{I, J} with I = J = 128. Absolute tolerance for iteration is determined to be 1E-8, and the initial value for the standard KFBI method is set as \u03d5_0 = (0, 0)^T."

Additionally, the development of a three-dimensional variant of the hybrid KFBI Method is identified as a pressing objective.

Despite attempts to substitute Green's function with a neural network \\cite{lin2023bi}, this approach has yet to attain high accuracy levels and struggles with variable coefficients. The KFBI method \\cite{ying2007kernel} circumvents the need for explicitly expressing Green's function. Here, integrals in (<ref>)-(<ref>) are treated as equivalent interface problems, facilitating the implementation of iterative steps \\eqref{one_GPU:richardson1}-\\eqref{one_GPU:richardson2}. Specifically, the double layer boundary integral (W\u03c6)(\ud835\udc31) and volume integral (Yf)(\ud835\udc31) are reformulated as the solution v(\ud835\udc31) of this interface problem, with pertinent terms detailed in table \\ref{tab:my_label}."

Suppose \u212c is partitioned into a uniform Cartesian grid \ud835\udcaf_h with mesh parameter h = x_i+1-x_i = y_j+1 - y_j. Let v_i,j = v_h(\ud835\udc29_i,j) be the finite difference approximation of v(\ud835\udc31) at the grid node \ud835\udc29_i, j. For the elliptic operator \u2112 for interface problem (<ref>) is approximated by five-point discrete operator \u2112_h on Cartesian grid \ud835\udcaf_h. If the right-hand side  f(\ud835\udc31) is sufficiently smooth, then the solution to the finite difference equation has second-order accuracy. However, the irregular domain leads to discontinuous f\u0303(\ud835\udc31), v(\ud835\udc31) and \u2202_\ud835\udc27v(\ud835\udc31) in (<ref>), resulting in unignorable truncation error to maintain the second order\\cite{ying2007kernel}."

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluids plays an essential role in modeling many physical phenomena, such as weather, climate, aerodynamics, and plasma physics. Fluids are well described by the Navier–Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10× finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.},

  abstract = {Well known to the machine learning community, the random feature model is a parametric approximation to kernel interpolation or regression methods. It is typically used to approximate functions mapping a finite-dimensional input space to the real line. In this paper, we instead propose a methodology for use of the random feature model as a data-driven surrogate for operators that map an input Banach space to an output Banach space. Although the methodology is quite general, we consider operators defined by partial differential equations (PDEs); here, the inputs and outputs are themselves functions, with the input parameters being functions required to specify the problem, such as initial data or coefficients, and the outputs being solutions of the problem. Upon discretization, the model inherits several desirable attributes from this infinite-dimensional viewpoint, including mesh-invariant approximation error with respect to the true PDE solution map and the capability to be trained at one mesh resolution and then deployed at different mesh resolutions. We view the random feature model as a nonintrusive data-driven emulator, provide a mathematical framework for its interpretation, and demonstrate its ability to efficiently and accurately approximate the nonlinear parameter-to-solution maps of two prototypical PDEs arising in physical science and engineering applications: the viscous Burgers' equation and a variable coefficient elliptic equation.},

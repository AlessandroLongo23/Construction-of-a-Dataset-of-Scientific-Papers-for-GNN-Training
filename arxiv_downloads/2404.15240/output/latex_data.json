Indeed, let J be the vanishing ideal of the two Snorbits of (b,a,a,…,a) and (d,c,c,…,c) where a ≠ b, c ≠ d and p1(b,a,a,…,a) = p1(d,c,c,…,c). The associated graded of J then clearly contains p1 and (xi  xj)(xk  xl), hence must be I. Row~7(b). I = (p1,p2,(xixj)(xkxl)) + ^4 for n ≥ 4. Here, ^4 is already contained in (p1,p2,(xixj)(xkxl)), so these generators form a minimal Snstable basis of N1. Moreover, ρ = P/I = ⟨ 1 ⟩⊕⟨ p3 ⟩⊕⟨ xi  xj ⟩⊕⟨ xi^2  xj^2 ⟩ = 2S^(n)⊕ 2 S^(n1,1).",

If now E ≠ 0, then localizing at p1 + E shows that (xi  xj) is contained in the localized ideal, so this ideal corresponds to Row~1, contradicting the fact that P/J ≅ρ. Hence, E = 0. If A ≠ 0, we can localize at p1 + A and obtain the ideal generated by (xixj)(xkxl) and p1,p2,p3 which is contained in the ideal of row~6; this is again impossible. Hence, A = 0 as well. The only parameters we are left with are C and F. This proves that the subset of ρ of ideals J with gr (J) = I and whose vanishing set contains the origin is either irreducible of dimension~2 or has dimension ≤ 1. Therefore, taking the additive group action back in, the subset of ρ of ideals J with gr (J) = I (without conditions on V(J)) is either irreducible of dimension~3 or has dimension ≤ 2.",

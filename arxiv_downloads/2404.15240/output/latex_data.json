The vanishing set of I is a symmetric point configuration, consisting of some number N of disjoint Snorbits with vanishing ideals I1, …, IN. The Chinese remainder theorem provides a canonical algebra isomorphism P/I ≅⊕i=1^N P/Ii which is Snequivariant, so it suffices to prove the case of only one orbit. Let q1, …, qk ∈ℂ ^n be the distinct points of this orbit and let λ = (λ1 ≥λ2 ≥⋯≥λm ≥ 1) ⊢ n be the corresponding partition, i.e., each qi has m distinct coordinates which occur with multiplicities λ1, …, λm. Again by the Chinese remainder theorem we obtain a canonical isomorphism P/I ≅⊕i=1^k P/qi of algebras, in particular of vector spaces. We define an Snmodule structure on the direct sum by \\begin{equation*} \\overline{f} \\in P/\\mm{qi} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sigma(\\overline{f}) \\coloneqq \\overline{\\sigma(f)} \\in P/\\mm{\\sigma(qi)}. \\end{equation*} In this way, the Chinese remainder isomorphism is also Snequivariant.

                                    "content": "Proof of Proposition~] We extend the proof of Proposition~. Let q ∈O(λ)⊆ℂ ^n. Up to a permutation, the first l1 entries of q are equal to a1 ∈ℂ, the following l2 entries are equal to a2 ∈ℂ, and so on, where a1, …, ak are all distinct. Each multiplicity li is a sum of some parts of λ in such a way that every part of λ shows up for exactly one of the li. In other words, there is a surjective map l:[m] → [k] such that li = ∑j ∈ l^1(i)λj. Denote by μ^i ⊢ li the partition given by those parts of λ indexed by l^1(i). We now denote by q = q1, q2, …, qs the distinct points of the Snorbit of q. For every ideal I ⊆ P in the fiber of the HilbertChow morphism over this orbit, the Chinese remainder theorem gives a canonical Snequivariant isomorphism \\begin{equation*} P/I \\cong P/I{q1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus P/I{q{s}}, \\quad f \\mapsto (f, \\ldots, f), \\end{equation*} where the Snmodule structure on the right side is defined similarly as in the proof of Proposition~. For the uniqueness of I it will be enough to prove the uniqueness of the Iqi because I = ⋂i=1^s Iqi. Without loss of generality we only show the uniqueness of Iq. Let G = Sl1×⋯× Slk denote the stabilizer of q, so that P/Iq is a Gmodule. We define I' ⊆ P to be the apolar ideal to the Gmodule \\begin{equation*} V \\coloneqq \\left( S^{\\mu^1} \\otimes 1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes 1 \\right) \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\left( 1 \\otimes 1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes S^{\\mu^k} \\right) \\subseteq P, \\end{equation*} all direct summands embedded in the smallest possible degrees d(μ^1), …, d(μ^k), i.e., V is spanned by all Specht polynomials for the partitions μ^1, …, μ^k in the respective sets of variables. (If some of the μ^i = (li) are trivial, we do not include the corresponding direct summands into V.) For any f ∈ P we can write f = f^1 + … + f^k + g, where f^i is the sum of all terms of f which only involve the ith set of variables, i.e., those indexed by l1 + … + li1 + 1, …, l1 + … + li, and g is the sum of all remaining terms. Certainly, differentiating a polynomial with respect to a variable it does not contain gives zero. Therefore, since the ith direct summand of V only involves the ith set of variables, it is clear that ⟨ f, V ⟩ = 0 if and only if ⟨ f^i, S^μ^i⟩ = 0 for all i = 1, …, k, where S^μ^i is understood again as the span of all Specht polynomials of type μ^i in the ith set of variables. This proves \\begin{equation*} P/I' \\cong \\left( \\mathbb{C} [x1,\\ldots,x{l1}]/I'1 \\right) \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\left( \\mathbb{C} [x{nlk+1},\\ldots, xn]/I'k \\right), \\end{equation*} where I'1 is the apolar ideal to S^μ^1⊆ℂ [x1,…,xl1]d(μ^1) etc., i.e., the I'i = Iμ^i are the Tanisaki ideals corresponding to the partition μ^i ⊢ li. In particular, P/I' ≅ M^μ^1⊗⋯⊗ M^μ^k as Gmodules. Let now I'q be the translate of I' whose only support point is q; this translation is Gequivariant. We claim Iq ⊆ I'q. For this, we first observe that the canonical map V → P/Iq is injective, i.e., no direct summand of V is contained in Iq. The reason is that the restriction of the Chinese remainder isomorphism above to S^λ⊆ Pd(λ) is injective. Now, S^λ⊆ Pd(λ) is generated by the Specht polynomials of shape λ, each of which is a multiple of the product of the corresponding Specht polynomials of the μ^i. In particular, any Specht polynomial for μ^i is nonzero in P/Iqi, hence indeed V injects into P/Iq. To see that Iq ⊆ I'q, we can first translate both ideals Gequivariantly into the origin. Note that V still injects into P/I0 because the Specht polynomials generating V are not affected by this translation. Now assume that there exists f ∈ I0 ∖ I'. Writing f = f^1 + … + f^k + g as above, we can assume without loss of generality that ⟨ f^1, S^μ^1⟩≠ 0. Multiplying f by some monomial h appearing in ⟨ f^1, S^μ^1⟩, we may replace f by hf, so that we can assume that the degree d(μ^1) part of f^1 does not annihilate S^μ^1. Hence the Gsubmodule of I0 generated by f contains an element f' which spans a Gsubmodule isomorphic to S^μ^1⊗ 1 ⊗⋯⊗ 1 such that the degree d(μ^1) part of f' is a Specht polynomial in S^μ^1. Moreover, f' does not have any nonzero homogeneous components of smaller degrees because P<d(μ^1) does not contain any copy of S^μ^1⊗ 1 ⊗⋯⊗ 1. Therefore, we may assume f' = a + b with a ∈ S^μ^1⊆ Pd(μ^1) a Specht polynomial and b ∈ P>d(μ^1). As f' spans a Gmodule isomorphic to S^μ^1⊗ 1 ⊗⋯⊗ 1, the polynomial b lies in the corresponding isotypic component of P and is divisible by a by Lemma~. Thus inductively, since 𝔪 ^N ⊆ I0 for some N, we obtain a ∈ I0. Therefore, the canonical map V → P/I0 has a nontrivial kernel, contradicting what we said above. So indeed, Iq ⊆ I'q. This implies \\begin{align*} \\binom{l1}{\\mu^1} \\cdots \\binom{lk}{\\mu^k} = \\dim\\mathbb{C} (P/I'q) \\leq \\dim\\mathbb{C} (P/Iq) &= {\\dim\\mathbb{C} (P/I)}{r} &= {\\binom{n}{\\lambda}}{|Sn|/|G|} = {\\binom{n}{\\lambda}}{\\binom{n}{l1,\\ldots,lk}} = \\binom{l1}{\\mu^1} \\cdots \\binom{lk}{\\mu^k}, \\end{align*} so for dimension reasons actually Iq = I'q. This proves the uniqueness of~Iq.",

                                    "content": "It suffices to show that the Tanisaki ideal Iλ is a smooth point of M^λ since it is the only torusfixed point. The tangent space at [Iλ] is isomorphic to P^Sn(Iλ,P/Iλ), the vector space of all Snequivariant Pmodule homomorphisms Iλ→ P/Iλ. Since Iλ lies in the smoothable component of M^λ which has dimension~2, it is enough to show that the dimension of the tangent space is at most~2. For this, note first that rλ(nl) = l+1 for all 0 ≤ l ≤λ2 and that λ2 + 1 = rλ(nλ2) = rλ(nλ2  1) = ⋯ = rλ(nλ1 + 1). We abbreviate er = er(x[n]). We will now repeatedly use the relation er(xS ∖ i) = er(xS)  xi er1(xS ∖ i) for all i ∈ S. First we can observe that \\begin{equation*} e2(x{[n1]}) = e2  xn e1(x{[n1]}) = e2  xn e1 + xn^2, \\end{equation*} hence xn^2 ∈ Iλ. Let I (p1,xi^2) ⊆ Iλ. Using the Newton identities and the last equation we can see that e2(x[n1]) ∈ I. Similarly, er(x[n1]) ∈ I for all r ≥ 2 = rλ(n1). Inductively, using the same idea, for all l ≤λ2 we have \\begin{align*} er(x{[nl]}) &= er(x{[nl]\\cup n})  xn e{r1}(x{[nl]}) &= er(x{[nl]\\cup n})  xn e{r1}(x{[nl]\\cup n}) + xn^2 e{r2}(x{[nl]}), \\end{align*} and for r ≥ rλ(nl) = l+1 = rλ(nl+1) + 1 all three terms lie in I. If λ1 ≤λ2 + 1, this implies Iλ = I. If λ1 ≥λ2 + 2, we continue as follows: For all l in the range λ1  1 ≥ l ≥λ2 + 1, the partial elementary symmetric polynomials erλ(|S|)(xS), |S| = nl, all have the same degree λ2 + 1, and for |S| = nλ1+1 = λ2 + 1 we get the squarefree monomial of degree λ2 + 1, so all other generators in this range are redundant. In the end we obtain Iλ = (p1,xi^2, Sn(x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1)). On the other hand, P/Iλ≅ M^λ = ⊕0 ≤ k ≤λ2 S^(nk,k) as follows from the combinatorial formula for the Kostka numbers. These two facts together give even more: If λ1 ≥λ2 + 2, what we have proven so far applied to the partition μ (λ1  1, λ2 + 1) shows further that Iλ is already generated by I together with only the Specht polynomials of shape μ = (λ1  1,λ2 + 1). Indeed, the canonical surjection \\begin{equation*} \\oplus{0 \\leq k \\leq \\lambda2+1} S^{(nk,k)} \\cong P/I\\mu \\twoheadrightarrow P/I\\lambda \\cong \\oplus{0 \\leq k \\leq \\lambda2} S^{(nk,k)} \\end{equation*} has kernel S^μ, embedded in degree d(μ) = λ2 + 1. Moreover, each Specht module S^(nk,k) in P/Iλ is embedded in degree k, hence in degree < λ2 + 1. Therefore, if I' denotes the ideal generated by I and all Specht polynomials of shape μ, we have a canonical surjection P/I' ↠ P/Iλ which is an isomorphism in degrees ≤λ2 + 1. But Iλ is generated in degrees ≤λ2 + 1, so I' = Iλ. Since M^λ does not contain any copy of S^μ, we deduce that a homomorphism f ∈P^Sn(Iλ,P/Iλ) is determined already by its values f(p1) = α· 1, f(p2) = β· 1 and f(xi^2xj^2) = γ· (xi  xj) for some α, β, γ∈ℂ. Hence it suffices to show that α, β, γ must satisfy some nontrivial linear relation. If λ1 > λ2 we will show that necessarily β = 0 and if λ1 = λ2 = n2 we will show that α = n2γ, finishing the proof. We start with λ1 > λ2. Since x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1∈ Iλ, we can consider its image under f. Write f(x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1) = f0 + f1 + … + fλ2 as a sum of its graded pieces. Then x1^2 x2 ⋯ xλ2 + 1∈ Iλ is both a multiple of x1^2 and of x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1 and therefore maps to both βn x2 ⋯ xλ2 + 1 and x1 f(x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1) at the same time. Therefore, all graded pieces of the two must be equal in P/Iλ, in particular \\begin{equation*} \\beta x2 \\cdots x{\\lambda2 + 1}  n x1 f{\\lambda2  1} \\in I\\lambda. \\end{equation*} Hence, this polynomial must annihilate every Specht polynomial of shape λ. However, since λ1 > λ2, there exists a Specht polynomial not involving the variable x1 at all (putting the 1 in the upper right corner of the tableau) and containing the monomial x2 ⋯ xλ2 + 1 (putting these indices successively in the second row, for example). This Specht polynomial is annihilated by the above polynomial if and only if β = 0. If λ1 = λ2 = n2, we have the following relation: Define g (x1x2) (x3x4) ⋯ (xn1  xn). Then \\begin{equation*} g p1 = \\sum{i odd} {g}{xi  x{i+1}} (xi^2  x{i+1}^2). \\end{equation*} This implies that (α  n2γ) · g ∈ Iλ which, since g is a Specht polynomial of shape λ, is only possible if α = n2γ.",

The tangent space at [Iλ] is isomorphic to P^Sn(Iλ,P/Iλ), the vector space of all Snequivariant Pmodule homomorphisms Iλ→ P/Iλ. Since Iλ lies in the smoothable component of M^λ which has dimension~2, it is enough to show that the dimension of the tangent space is at most~2. For this, note first that rλ(nl) = l+1 for all 0 ≤ l ≤λ2 and that λ2rλ(nλ2) =  = rλ(nλ1 + 1). We abbreviate er = er(x[n]). We will now repeatedly use the relation er \\begin{equation*} e2∈ Iλ. Let I (p1,xi^x[n1]) ∈ I. Similarly, er(x[n1]) ∈ I for all r ≥ 2 = rλ(n1). Inductivelyhave \\begin{align*} er(x{[nl]}) &= er(x{[nl]\\cup n})  xn e{r1}(x{[nl]}) &= er(x{[nl]\\cup n})  xn e{r1}(x{[nl]\\cup If λ1 ≤λ2 + 1, this implies Iλ = I. If λ1 2 + 2, we continue as follows: For all l in the rae λ1  1 ≥ l ≥λ2 + 1, the partial elemenry symmetric polynomials erλ(|S|)(xS), |S| = nl, all have the same degree λ2 + 1, and for |S| = nλ1+1 = λ2 + 1 we get the squarefree monomial of degree λ2 + 1, so all other generators in this range are redundant. In the end we obtain Iλ = (p1,xi^2, Sn(x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1)). On the other hand, P/Iλ≅ M^λ = ⊕0 ≤ k ≤λ2 S^(nk,k) as follows from the combinatorial formula for the Kostka numbers. These two facts together give even more: If λ1 ≥λ2 + 2, what we have proven so far applied to the partition μ (λ1  1, λht polynon*} \\oplus{0 \\leq k \\leq \\lambda20 \\leq k \\leq \\lambda2} S^{(nk,k)} \\end{equation*} has kernel S^μ, embedded in degree d(μ) = λ2 + 1. Moreover, each Specht module S^(nk,k) in P/Iλ is embedded in degree k, hence in degree < λ2 + 1. Therefore, if I' denotes the ideal generated by I and all Specht polynomorphism in degrees ≤λ2 + 1. But Iλ is generated in degrees ≤λ2 + 1, so I' = Iλ. Since M^λ does not contaid already by its values f(p1) = α· 1, f(p2) = β· 1 and f(xi^2xj^2) = γ· (xi  xj) for some α, β, γ∈ℂ. Hence it suffices to must satisfy some nontrivial linear relation. If λ1 > λ2 we will show that necessarily β and if λ1 = λ2 = n2 we will show that α = n2γ, finishing the proof. We start with λ1 > λ2. Since x1 x2 + fλ2 as a sum of ix1^2 x2 ⋯ xλ2 + 1∈ Iλ is both a multiple of x1^2 and of x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1 and therefore maps to both βn x2 ⋯ xλ2 + 1 and x1 f(x1 x2 ⋯ xλ2+1) at the sad pieces of the two must be equal in P/Iλ, in particular \\bI\\lambda. \\end{equation*} Hence, this polynomial must annihilate every Spechtmial of shape λ. However, since λ1 > λng the 1 in the upper right corner of the tableau) and contaiw, for example= 0. If λ1 = λ2 = n2, we have the following relation: Define g (x1x2) (x3x4) ⋯ (xn1  xn). Then \\begin{equation*} g p1 = \\sui odd} {g}{xi  x{i+1}} (xi^2  x{i+1}^2). \\end{equation*}  n2γ) · g ∈ Iλ which, since g is a Specht polynomial of shape λ, is only n2γ."

Any monomial occurring in T is a permutation of the monomial x1^{|C1|1}x2^{|C1|2}\\cdots x^1{|C1|1} \\cdot x{|C1|}^{|C2|1} x{|C1|+1}^{|C2|2} \\cdots x^1{|C1|+|C2|2} \\cdots x{|C1|+\\ldots+|C{l1}|l+2}^{|Cl|1}\\cdots x{|C1|+\\ldots+|C{l}|l}^1. This monomial lies in the ideal (Sn · x1^m, Sn · (x1 x2 ⋯ xRk(μ))^k | 1 ≤ k ≤ m1) if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ m such that for at least Rk(μ) distinct indices j, xj^k divides the monomial. For each column Ci we have max|Ci|k,0 distinct variables occurring with exponent at least k in the monomial. Now, \\begin{align*} \\sum{i=1}^l\\max{|Ci|k,0} &= \\sum{i=1, |Ci| \\geq k+1}^l |Ci|k &= \\sum{t \\geq k+1}\\sum{\\substack{i=1, |Ci|=t}}^l tk &= \\sum{t \\geq k+1} (\\lambdat\\lambda{t+1})(tk) &= \\sum{r \\geq 1} (\\lambda{k+r}\\lambda{k+r+1})r &= \\lambda{k+1}\\lambda{k+2}+2\\lambda{k+2}2\\lambda{k+3}+\\ldots &= \\lambda{k+1} + \\lambda{k+2} + \\lambda{k+3} + \\ldots &= Rk(\\lambda)1. \\end{align*} Since # j : (λ')j ≥ k = λk and because μλ, there is an integer s with μ1+…+μs > λ1 + … +λs. However, this is equivalent to n  (μ1+…+μs) < n  (λ1+…+λs) which in turn is equivalent to μm + … + μs+1 + 1 < λ (λ)+…+λs+1+1. The left hand side equals Rs(μ) and the right hand side equals Rs(λ). Thus, we obtain Rs(μ) ≤ Rs(λ)1, as desired.",

                                    "content": "Proof of Classification in Table~] This is a case distinction using Lemma~. If I1 = P1, then I = 𝔪, and if I1 = ⟨ xixj ⟩, then I = (xixj) + 𝔪 ^r for some r, so P/I = r S^(n), corresponding to row~1 in Table~. Hence, we can assume that either I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩ or I1 = 0. We will begin with I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩. In this case, (P/I)≤ 1 = n, so (P/I)≥ 2 = rn ≤ n. Now, (S^(n2,2)) = n(n3)2. For n ≥ 6, this is always >n. Hence, the dimension constraint r ≤ 2n implies (xixj)(xkxl) ∈ I for all n ≥ 6. Let us, therefore, first assume (xixj)(xkxl) ∈ I for any n ≥ 3 (for n=3 this is a vacuous condition). If both of p2 and xi^2xj^2 do not lie in I, then necessarily I = (p1,(xixj)(xkxl)) + 𝔪 ^3 since already (P/I)≤ 2 = 2n. This ideal is the first ideal in row~7 of Table~. If p2 ∈ I but xi^2  xj^2 ∉I, we get either the ideal of row~6 or, for n ≥ 4, the second ideal of row~7. This follows using Lemma~ and observing that (xixj)(xixk)(xjxk) ∈ ((xixj)(xkxl)) ⊆ I for all n ≥ 4, as the following equation shows: \\begin{align*} (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3) &= (x3  x1) \\cdot (x1x2)(x3x4) &+ (x1x2) \\cdot (x1x3)(x2x4). \\end{align*} For n=3 there are two more possibilities here, namely rows~12 and~13. If both p2 ∈ I and xi^2  xj^2 ∈ I, then I = (p1) + 𝔪 ^2, row~3. Otherwise, xi^2  xj^2 ∈ I but p2 ∉I. Applying the Reynolds operator to (x1^2  x2^2)x1 gives a scalar multiple of n p3  p2p1, hence p3 ∈ I. Therefore, (P/I)3 does not contain any trivial representation. Moreover, (P/I)≤ 2 = n+1. However, (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3) ∈ (xi^2xj^2) for all n ≥ 3. Indeed, the formula \\begin{equation*} (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3) = x1(x3^2x2^2) + x2(x1^2x3^2) + x3(x2^2x1^2) \\end{equation*} can easily be verified. Moreover, by Lemma~, for all n ≥ 3 we have p2(xixj), xi^3xj^3 ∈ (p1(xixj),xi^2xj^2,(xixj)(xkxl)) ⊆ I, implying I3 = P3, so we obtain the second ideal of row~4. Otherwise, still assuming I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩, we have n ∈4,5 and (xixj)(xkxl) ∉I. If n=5, then necessarily I = (p1,p2,xi^2xj^2) + 𝔪 ^3 for dimension reasons, which is row~8. If n=4, then we have (P/I)≤ 2≥ 6, so necessarily xi^2xj^2 ∈ I for dimension reasons. Applying again the Reynolds operator to (x1^2x2^2)x1, we get p3 ∈ I. Hence, if p2 ∈ I, we get row~9. If instead p2 ∉I, then we get the first ideal of row~10. This finishes the case I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩. Secondly, we assume I1 = 0, so (P/I)≤ 1 = n+1. For n ≥ 5 and n=3, all irreducible Snrepresentations except for the trivial and the alternating one have dimension ≥ n1. Moreover, the least degree k such that Pk contains an alternating representation is k = n2 which is >n for all n ≥ 4. Hence, for all n ≥ 5, this forces that (P/I)≥ 2 is either 0, a direct sum of only trivial representations or S^(n1,1), and in the last case (even for n=3,4) this forces I3 = P3 for dimension reasons, so we obtain the third ideal of row~7 for some (a,b) ≠ (0,0). If (P/I)2 = 0, then I = 𝔪 ^2, so we get the first ideal of row~4 (even for n=3,4). Otherwise, assume we have any n ≥ 3 and that (P/I)≥ 2 only consists of trivial representations, necessarily of exactly (rn1) many. We claim that we can only get the two ideals of row~2 or the ideal of row~5 for some (a,b) ≠ (0,0) (the case (a,b) = λ (1,n) gives the same as the first ideal of row~2). The reasoning is as follows. Let J be the ideal generated by all nontrivial representations in all degrees 2 ≤ k ≤ n1 and by 𝔪 ^n. Then, clearly, J ⊆ I. But we also know J ⊆ (xixj)≥ 2 + 𝔪 ^n. Next, we claim that (P/J)k has dimension at most 1 for all k ≥ 3. For this, observe that p1(xixj) ∈ I and xi^kxj^k ∈ I for all k ≥ 2 for dimension reasons. Applying again the Reynolds operator to pd(x1x2)x1, d ∈1,2, and to (x1^kx2^k)x1 gives scalar multiples of n pd p2  pd p1^2 and npk+1  pkp1, respectively. The claim (P/J)k ≤ 1 for all k ≥ 3 easily follows from this. For dimension reasons, then, Jk = (xixj)k or Ik = Pk for all k ≥ 3. Hence, the same is true for Ik for all k ≥ 3. This shows that we indeed get one of the three ideals in rows~2 and~5. The only remaining cases are n ∈3,4 and such that (P/I)≥ 2 contains some nontrivial representation which is also different from S^(n1,1). For n=4, then, we must have S^(2,2) in (P/I)2, i.e., (xixj)(xkxl) ∉I. Hence, (P/I)≤ 2≥ 7. Moreover, both p1(xixj) and xi^2xj^2 are necessarily in I for dimension reasons, and some linear combination of p1^2 and p2 must also be contained in I, again for dimension reasons. Hence, we get either the second ideal of row~10 or the ideal of row~11 for some (a,b) ≠ (0,0). Finally, for n=3, the only possibility for a nontrivial representation in (P/I)≥ 2 not equal to S^(2,1) is the alternating representation S^(1,1,1) in degree 3, generated by (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3). Then I contains (p1(xixj),xi^2xj^2) for dimension reasons. But we have already seen that then automatically (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3) ∈ I as well, so this is impossible.",

If I1 = P1, then I = 𝔪, and if I1 = ⟨ xixj ⟩, then I = (xixj) + 𝔪 ^r for some r, so P/I = r S^(n), corresponding to row~1 in Table~. Hence, we can assume that either I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩ or I1 = 0. We will begin with I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩. In this case, (P/I)≤ 1 = n, so (P/I)≥ 2 = rn ≤ n. Now, (S^(n2,2)) = n(n3)2. For n ≥ 6, this is always >n. Hence, the dierefore, first assume (xixj)(xkxl) ∈ I for any n ≥ 3 (for n=essarily I = (p1,(xixj)(xkxl)) + 𝔪 ^3 since already (P/I)≤ 2 = 2n. This ideal is the firs~7 of Table~. If p2 ∈ I but xi^2  xj^2 ∉I, we get either the ideal of row~6 or, for n ≥ 4, the second ideal of row~7. This follows using Lemma~ and observing that (xixj)(xixk)(xjxk) ∈ ((xixj)(xkxl)) ⊆ I for all n ≥ 4, as the following ex2x3) &= (x3  x1) \\cdot (x1x2)(x3x4) &+ (x1x2) \\cdot (x1x3)(x2x4). \\end{align*} For n=3 there are two more possibilities herOtherwise, xi^2  xj^2 ∈ I but p2 ∉I. Applying the Reynolds operator to (x1^2  x2^2)x1 gives a scalar mulefore, (P/I)3 does not contain any trivial representation. Moreover, (P/I)≤ 2 = n+1. However, (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3) ∈ (xi^2xj^2) for all n ≥ 3. Indeed, the formula \\begin{equation*} (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3) = x1(x3^2x2^2) + x2(x1^2x3^2) + x3(x2^2x1^2) \\end{equation*} can easily be verified. Moreover, by Lemma~, for all n ≥ 3 we have p2(xixj), xi^3xj^3 ∈ (p1(xixj),xi^2xj^2,(xixj)(xkxl)) ⊆ I, implying I3 = P3, so we obtain the second ideal of row~4. Otherwise, still assuming I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩, we have n ∈4,5 andmension reasons, which is row~8. If n=4, then we have (P/I)≤ 2≥ 6, so necessarily xi^2xj^2 ∈ I for dimension reasons. Applying again the Reynolds operator to (x1^2x2^2)x1, we get p3 ∈ I. Hence, if p2 ∈ I, we get  the case I1 = ⟨ p1 ⟩. Secondly, assume I1 = 0, so (P/I)≤ 1 = n+1. For n ≥ 5 and n= one have dimensl n ≥ 4. Hence, for allfor dimension reasons, so we obtain the third irst ideal of row~4 (even for n=3,4). Otherwise, assume we have any n ≥ 3 and that (P/I)≥ 2 only consists of trivial representations, necessarily of exactly (rn1) many. We claim that we can only get the two ideals of row~2 othe same as the first ideal of row~2). The reasoning is as follows. Let J be the ideal generated by all nontrivial representations in all degrees 2 ≤ k ≤ Next, we claim that (P/J)k has dimension at most 1 for all k ≥ 3. For this, observe that p1(xixj) ∈ I and xi^kxj^k ∈ I for all k ≥ 2 for dimension r (x1^kx2^k)x1 gives scalar multiples of n pd p2  pd p1^2 and npk+1  pkp1, respectively. The claim (P/J)k ≤ for all k ≥ 3 easily follows from this. For dimension in (P/I)2, i.e., (xixj)(xkxl) ∉I. Hence, (P/I)≤ 2≥ 7. Moreover, both p1(xixj) and xi^2xj^2 are necessarily in I for dimension reasons, and some linear combination of p1^2 second ideal of row~10 or the ideal of row~for some (a,b) ≠ (0,0). Finally, for n=3, alternating representation S^(1,1,1) in degree 3, generated by (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3). "

For smoothness one only has to check that the tangent space dimension agrees with the dimension of the smoothable component and argue that it contains the respective ideal which is the case for all ideals in Table~.

For this, observe that there is no linear dependence among the degree 2 generators of N1 and that every homogeneous multiple of (xixj) and p1^d1 with strictly larger degree already lies in I. Therefore, there is no linear relation among the remaining α,β,γd1,δ1,…,δd1 which actually involves at least one of α, β, γd1. Therefore, the only possible linear relations are among δ1, …, δd1. By what we have explained above, such a relation arises from a syzygy of the generators of N1 such that the coefficient g of p1^d is a homogeneous polynomial which is nonzero in P/I. If (g) ≥ 2, then after rescaling we have g = p1^k I for some 2 ≤ k ≤ d1. But such a syzygy does not exist since no power p1^k (including k = 0 and k = 1) is contained in (xi  xj)≥ 2. Therefore, the only case left is g ∈⟨ xi  xj ⟩. But this gives precisely the relation we have already used above to show δ0 = 0. This proves ℂ (Hom ^SnP(I,P/I)) = d+2.",

For this, let a, b, c2, c3, …, cd ∈ℂ such that a ≠ b and c2, c3, …, cd are all distinct. Define J(a,b,c2,c3,…,cd) to be the vanishing ideal of the points given by the Snorbit of (b,a,a,…,a) and the d1 diagonal points (c2,…, c2), …, (cd, …, cd). The product of the d polynomials p1  ((n1)a + b) and p1  n ci clearly lies in J, and its top degree part is precisely p1^d. Also, for all degree 2 generators of N1 except for p1^2  np2 there is a polynomial in J whose top degree part is precisely this generator. This is evidenced by the polynomials (xi  xj)(xi + xj  (a+b)), (xi  xj)(p1  ((n1)a + b)) and (xi  xj)(xk  xl). Fixing c2, …, cd and letting (a,b) tend to (0,0) linearly, i.e., along the family (ta,tb), we obtain the ideal J(c2,…,cd) = ((p1) + 𝔪 ^2) ∩(c2,…,c2)∩⋯∩(cd,…,cd).

We claim that J(c2,…,cd) also contains p1^2  n p2. But this is clear since this polynomial is obviously contained in (p1) + 𝔪 ^2 and vanishes on all diagonal points. Hence, letting (c2, …, cd) tend to (0,…, 0) linearly, i.e., along the family (tc2,…, tcd) which lies entirely in the smoothable component, the limiting ideal contains p1^2  np2 and all the above polynomials with all parameters replaced by 0, which is a generating set for I.

                                    "content": "For rows~1,~3,~6 and~813 this follows from smoothness and connectedness in each case. For the remaining rows~2,~4,~5~and~7, we have seen that all homogeneous symmetric ideals lie in the respective smoothable components, proving connectedness of ρ in each case. It is therefore enough to consider the homogeneous symmetric ideals I which are singular points of ρ and to prove, in each case, that all ideals whose associated graded equals I lie in the smoothable component again. The three singular ideals in rows~2, 4 and~5 can all be written as I = (xixj)≥ 2 + 𝔪 ^d, where d=2 for row~4, d=3 for row~5, and d>3 for row~2. Let now J ⊆ P be any symmetric ideal whose associated graded is I. For d ≥ 3, we use \\begin{equation*} N1 = \\langle xi^2  xj^2 \\rangle \\oplus \\langle p1(xi  xj) \\rangle \\oplus \\langle (xi  xj)(xk  xl) \\rangle \\oplus \\langle p1^2  n p2 \\rangle \\oplus \\langle p1^d \\rangle \\end{equation*} as generators for I. We claim that J has generators of the form \\begin{gather*} (xi  xj)(xk  xl), p1(xi  xj) + a1(xi  xj), xi^2  xj^2 + a2(xi  xj), p1^2  np2 + b1 p1 + b2, p1^d + \\sum{i=0}^{d1} ci p1^i, \\end{gather*} for some a1,a2,b1,b2,ci ∈ℂ. For instance, since (xi  xj)(xk  xl) ∈ I and I is the associated graded of J, there is an element (xi  xj)(xk  xl) + ℓ + c ∈ J for some linear form ℓ and some constant c. Applying the transposition (i,j) to this polynomial yields (xi  xj)(xk  xl) + (i,j)(ℓ) + c ∈ J, hence the sum must lie in J as well, and equals ℓ + (i,j)(ℓ) + 2c. It follows that ℓ = λ (xi  xj) for some λ∈ℂ and that c = 0. For the same reason, we also get ℓ = μ (xk  xl) for some μ∈ℂ, hence ℓ = 0. The reasoning for the other generators is similar. Note that for all k ≥ 1, we have p1^k(x1  x2) ≡ a1 p1^k1(x1x2) J and hence p1^k(x1x2) ≡ (a1)^k(x1x2) J for all k ≥ 0. Let cd 1. Then we have \\begin{align*} J &\\ni \\left( \\sum{k=0}^d ck p1^k \\right)(x1x2)  (p1(x1x2) + a1(x1x2)) \\left( \\sum{k=0}^{d1} c{k+1}p1^k \\right) &= c0 (x1x2)  a1 \\sum{k=0}^{d1} c{k+1} p1^k (x1x2) &\\equiv \\left( (a1)^d + c{d1}(a1)^{d1} + \\ldots + c0 \\right) (x1x2) \\pmod J . \\end{align*} Hence, we must have (a1)^d + cd1(a1)^d1 + … + c0 = 0. Moreover, \\begin{align*} J &\\ni {1}{(n2)!} \\sum{\\sigma \\in Sn} \\sigma (x1(p1(x1x2) + a1(x1x2)))  p1(p1^2  np2 + b1 p1 + b2) &= a1 (p1^2  n p2)  b1 p1^2  b2 p1 &\\equiv b1 p1^2  (a1 b1 + b2)p1  a1 b2 \\pmod J . \\end{align*} Since d ≥ 3, we obtain b1 = 0 and hence also b2 = 0. Together with the previous equation we obtain a flat family over an irreducible base isomorphic to an affine space of dimension d+1 (since we can eliminate the three variables b1,b2,c0). Since the subset of the smoothable component consisting of all ideals whose associated graded is I has dimension d+1 as well, the general member of this family must be a smoothable ideal, hence every member of the family is a smoothable ideal, proving our claim. For d=2 we use instead the monomial generators of I = 𝔪 ^2 and obtain the following generators for J: \\begin{gather*} xi xj + a1 (xi + xj) + a2 p1 + a3, xi^2 + b1 xi + b2 p1 + b3. \\end{gather*} Since ℂ (P/J) = n+1, the vanishing set of J must contain at least one point on the diagonal. Hence, using the 𝔾aaction, we may assume that the origin is contained in the vanishing set of J, i.e., a3 = b3 = 0. But which parameters a1,a2,b1,b2 do then actually give us an ideal J of the correct colength? Clearly, the associated graded of J contains 𝔪 ^2 for every choice of parameters. But equality need not hold in general; the obstruction are linear forms contained in J. These linear forms, however, can only arise from syzygies of the monomial generators of 𝔪 ^2 in degree~3, i.e., from the identities xi^2 xj = xi (xi xj) and (xi xj) xk = xi (xj xk). Using these, we obtain all possible linear forms contained in J. Their coefficients yield 3 linearly independent homogeneous polynomials F1,F2,F3 of degree 2 in a1,a2,b1,b2. The coefficients of the Fi, in turn, are integer constants or linear polynomials in n. Treating n as a variable, we consider the ideal (F1,F2,F3) in the polynomial ring ℚ [a1,a2,b1,b2,n]. A computation in Macaulay2 then provides the minimal primes of this ideal (over ℚ). They are 𝔭1 (a1,b1,a2b2) and 𝔭2 (b2+a1+(n1)a2, a1^2 + (n2)a1 a2 + a2 b1). Both are geometrically prime, i.e., prime over ℂ, even if n is regarded as an integer again. The first prime ideal 𝔭1 only parametrizes ideals defining a subscheme of ℂ ^n for which the origin is not reduced. Precisely, apart from 𝔪 ^2 itself, the members of the family defined by 𝔭1 have the form ((p1) + 𝔪 ^2) ∩(c,c,…,c) for some c ∈∖0. We have already seen that these ideals all lie in the smoothable component. The flat family defined by 𝔭2 must then contain, in particular, the set of all symmetric ideals whose associated graded is 𝔪 ^2 and which define a subscheme of ℂ ^n for which the origin is a reduced point. Now, the general radical ideal in ρ has associated graded equal to 𝔪 ^2, and the subset whose vanishing set contains the origin has dimension 2. On the other hand, (ℂ [a1,a2,b1,b2]/𝔭2) = 2 as well. Therefore, by irreducibility, every member of the family defined by 𝔭2 is smoothable, concluding the argument. For the last remaining singular ideal I = (p1^2,p2,p1(xixj),(xixj)(xkxl)) + 𝔪 ^3 of Row~7(c) the reasoning is as follows. We assume first n ≥ 4. Let J ⊆ P be any symmetric ideal with gr (J) = I. We use \\[N1 = \\langle p1^2 \\rangle \\oplus \\langle p2 \\rangle \\oplus \\langle p1(xixj) \\rangle \\oplus \\langle (xixj)(xkxl) \\rangle \\oplus \\langle p3 \\rangle \\] as generators for I. Then, clearly, J has generators of the form \\begin{align*} (xixj)(xkxl), p1^2 + A p1 + B, p2 + C p1 + D, p1(xixj) + E (xixj), p3 + F p1 + G. \\end{align*} First, we note that I is not the associated graded ideal of any radical ideal. The reason is that the only possible radical ideals are the vanishing ideals of two distinct orbits represented by (b,a,a,…,a) and (d,c,c,…,c) for a ≠ b, c ≠ d. If p1(b,a,a,…,a) = p1(d,c,c,…,c), then clearly p1 is contained in the associated graded but not in I. Otherwise the associated graded contains some linear combination of p1(x1x2) and x1^2  x2^2 in which the latter occurs with a nonzero coefficient while I only contains the former. Next, we claim that the vanishing set of J contains a diagonal point. To see this, note that the vanishing set of a symmetric ideal J whose associated graded is I, which is not radical and whose vanishing set does not contain a diagonal point must consist of precisely one orbit generated by (b,a,a,…,a) for a ≠ b. Every point must have multiplicity 2 by symmetry and since ℂ (P/J) = 2n. The stabilizer of the subscheme of Spec (P/J) supported at a single point, say (b,a,a,…,a) is precisely Sn1, embedded into Sn as the permutations fixing the first index. Since its multiplicity is 2, the subscheme supported at (b,a,a,…,a) is defined by the ideal ((x1b)^2, x2  a, …, xn  a), so that J is the intersection of all permutations of this ideal. However, this is impossible since the associated graded then would not contain p1(x1x2) as can be checked after reducing to a=0 via the additive group action. Hence, we may assume V(J) contains the origin, so that all constant terms of the above generators are zero. If now E ≠ 0, then localizing at p1 + E shows that (xi  xj) is contained in the localized ideal, so this ideal corresponds to Row~1, contradicting the fact that P/J ≅ρ. Hence, E = 0. If A ≠ 0, we can localize at p1 + A and obtain the ideal generated by (xixj)(xkxl) and p1,p2,p3 which is contained in the ideal of row~6; this is again impossible. Hence, A = 0 as well. The only parameters we are left with are C and F. This proves that the subset of ρ of ideals J with gr (J) = I and whose vanishing set contains the origin is either irreducible of dimension~2 or has dimension ≤ 1. Therefore, taking the additive group action back in, the subset of ρ of ideals J with gr (J) = I (without conditions on V(J)) is either irreducible of dimension~3 or has dimension ≤ 2. Let now H be the locally closed subset of ρ of all ideals having the same Hilbert function h as I. We endow H with the reduced scheme structure. By Subsection~, there is a natural map φ H ⟶ Hilb ^Sn ×ℂ ^∗ρ,h(ℂ ^n), sending an ideal I to its associated graded gr (I). Note that the target of φ consists precisely of the ideals in Row~7(c), so it is irreducible of dimension~1. Moreover, all fibers of φ over closed points corresponding to homogeneous ideals I' have a component of dimension at least 3 containing I'. Indeed, for any such ideal in Row~7(c) other than I itself consider the vanishing ideal J of two distinct orbits represented by (b,a,a,…,a) and (d,c,c,…,c), a ≠ b, c ≠ d. If p1(b,a,a,…,a) ≠ p1(d,c,c,…,c), then there is a unique α∈ℂ such that α p1(x1  x2) + (x1^2  x2^2) + β (x1  x2) ∈ J for some β∈ℂ. This shows that J belongs to Row~7(c). Conversely, given any α∈ℂ, the existence of β such that the above polynomial belongs to J defines exactly one linear condition on a,b,c,d. Observe that this means that the fiber of φ over gr (J) contains a 3dimensional subset of the smoothable component containing gr (J). Let Z be the smoothable component of ρ. Consider the composition \\begin{equation*} (Z \\cap H){red} \\hookrightarrow H \\overset{\\varphi}{\\longrightarrow} Hilb ^{Sn \\times \\mathbb{C} ^\\ast}{\\rho,h}(\\mathbb{C} ^n). \\end{equation*} By the upper semicontinuity of fiber dimensions (on the source!), the intersection φ^1([I]) ∩ Z has dimension at least 3. This proves, first, that φ^1([I]) is actually irreducible of dimension 3 and, second, that this entire fiber φ^1([I]) lies in the smoothable component Z. This in turn proves the irreducibility of ρ for n ≥ 4. For n = 3, the role of (xixj)(xkxl) is played by (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3). With this replacement all arguments stay the same.",

For the remaining rows~2,~4,~5~and~7, we have seen that all homogeneous symmetric ideals lie in the respective smoothable components, proving connectedness of ρ in each case. It is therefore enough to consider the homogeneous symmetric ideals I which are singular points of ρ and to prove, in each case, that all ideals whose associated graded equals I lie in the smoothable component again. The three singular ideals in rows~2, 4 and~5 can all be written as I = (xixj)≥ 2 + 𝔪 ^d, where d=2 for row~4, d=3 for row~5, and d>3 for row~2. Let now J ⊆ P be any symmetric ideal whose associated graded is I.

For the same reason, we also nerators is similar. Note that for all k ≥ 1, we have p1^k(x1  x2) ≡ a1 p1^k1(x1x2) J and hence p1^k(x1x2) ≡ (a1)^k(x1x2) J for all k ≥ 0. Let cd 1. Then we have \\begin{align*} J &\\ni \\left( \\sum{k=0}^d ck p1^k \\right)(x1x2)  (p1(x1x2) + a1(x1x2)) \\left( \\sum{k=0}^{d1} c{k+1}p1^k \\right) &= c0 (x1x2)  a1 \\sum{k=0}^{d1} c{k+1} p1^k (x1x2) &\\equiv \\left( (a1)^d + c{d1}(a1)^{d1} + \\ldots \\end{align*} Hence, we mustn*{(n2)!} \\sum{\\sigma \\in Sn} \\sigma (x1(p1(x1x2) + a1(x1x2)))  p1(p1^2  np2 + b1 p1 + b2) &= a1 (p1^2  n p2)  b1 p1^2  b2 p1 &\\equiv b1 p1^2  (a1 b1 + b2)p1  a1 b2 \\pmod J . \\end{align*} Since d ≥ 3, we obtain flat family over an irreducible base isomorphic to an affine space of dimension d+1 (since we can eliminate the three variables b1,b2,c0). Since the subset of the smoothable component consisting of all ideals whose associated graded is I has dimension d+1 as well, the general member of this family must be a smoothable ideal, hence every member of the family is a smoothable ideal, proving our claim. For d=2 we use instead the monomial generators of I = 𝔪 ^2 and obtain the following generators for J: \\begin{gather*} xi xj + a1 (xi + xj) + a2 p1 + a3, xi^2 + b1 xi + b2 p1 + b3. \\end{gather*} Since ℂ (P/J) = n+1, the vanishing set of J must contain at least one point on the diagonal. Hence, using the 𝔾aaction, we may assume that the origin is contained in the vanishing set of J, i.e., a3 = b3 = 0. But which parameters a1,a2,b1,b2 do then actually give us an ideal J of the correct colength? Clearly, the associated gradedgeneral; the obstruction are linear forms contained in J. These linear forms, however, can only arise from syzygies of the monomial generators of 𝔪 ^2 in degree~3, i.e., from thxj) xk = xi (xj xk). Using these, we obtain all possible linear forms contained in J. Their coefficients yield endent homogeneous polynomials F1,F2,F3 of degree 2 in a1,a2,b1,b2. The coefficients of the Fi, in turn, are integer constants or linear polynomials in n. Treating n as a variable, we consider the ideal (F1,F2,F3) in the polynomial ring ℚ [a1,a2,b1,b2,n]. A computation in Macaulay2 then provides the1)a2, a1^2 + (n2)a1 a2 + a2 b1). Both are geometrically prime, i.e., prime over ℂ, even if n is regarded as an integer again. The first prime iigin is not reduced. Precisely, apart from 𝔪 ^2 itself, the members of the family defined by 𝔭1 have the form ((p1) + 𝔪 ^2) ∩(c,c,…,c) for some c ∈∖0. We have already seen that these ideals all lie in the smoothable component. The flat family defined by 𝔭2 musd is 𝔪 ^2 and which define a subscheme of ℂ ^n for which the origin is a reduced point. Now, the general radical ideal in ρ has associated graded equal to 𝔪 ^2, and the subset wa2,b1,b2]/𝔭2) = 2 as well. Therefore, by irreducibility, every member of the family defined by 𝔭2 is smoothable, concluding the argument. For the last remaining singular ideal I = (p1^2,p2,p1(xixj),(xixj)(xkxl)) + 𝔪 ^3 of Row~7(c) the reasoning is as follows. We assume first n ≥ 4. Let J ⊆ P be any symmetric le \\oplus \\langle p1(xixj) \\rangle \\oplus \\langle (xixj)(xkxl) \\rangle \\oplus \\langle p3 \\rangle \\] as generators for I. Then, clearly,p1 + D, p1(xixj) + E (xixj), p3 + F p1 + G. \\end{align*} First, we note tha graded ideal of any radical ideal. The reason is that the only possible radical ideals are the vanishing ideals of two distinct orbits represented by (b,a,a,…,a) and (d,c,c,…,c) for a ≠ b, c ≠ d. If p1(b,a,a,…,a) = p1(d,c,c,…,c), then clearly p1 is contained in the associated graded but not in I. Otherwise the associated graded contains some linear combination of p1(x1x2) and x1^2  x2^2 inlatter occurs with a nonzero coefficient while I only contains the former. Next, we claim that the vanishing set of J contains a diagonal point. To see this, note that the vanishing set of a symmetric ideal J whose associated graded is I, which is not radical and whose vanishing set does not contain a diagonal point must consist of precisely one orbit generated by (b,a,a,…,a) for a ≠ b. since ℂ (P/J) = 2n. The stabilizer of the subscheme of Spec (P/J) supported at a single point, say (b,a,a,…,a) is precisely ltiplicity is 2, the subscheme supported at (b,a,a,…,a) is defined by tions of this ideal. However, this is impossible since the associated graded then would not contain p1(x1x2) as can be checked after reducing to a=0 via the additive group action. Hence, we may assume V(J) contains the origin, so that all constant termthat (xi  xj) is contained in the localized ideal, so this ideal corresponds to Row~1, contradicting the fact that P/J ≅ρ. Hence, E = 0. If A ≠ 0, we can localize at p1 + A and obtain the ideal generated by (xixj)(xke. Hence, A = 0 as well. e subset of ρ of ideals J with gr (J) = I and whose vanishing set contains the origin is either irreducible of dimension~2 or has dimension ≤ 1. Therefore, taking the additive group action back in, the subset of ρ of iddimension~3 or has dimension ≤ 2. Let now H be the locally closed subset of ρ of all ideals having the same Hilbert function h as I. We endow H with the H ⟶ Hilb ^Sn ×ℂ ^∗ρ,h(ℂ ^n), sending an ideal I to its associated graded gr (I). Note that the target ofis irreducible of dimension~1. Moreover, all fibers of φ over closed points corresponding to homogeneous ideals I' have a component of dimension at least 3 containing I'. Indeed, for any such ideal in Row~7(c) other than I itself consider the vanishing ideal J of two distinct orbits represented by (b,a,a,…,a) and (d,c,c,…,c), a ≠ b, c ≠ d. If p1(b,a,a,…,a) ≠ p1(d,c,c,…,c), then there is a unique α∈ℂ such that α p1(x1  x2) + (x1^2  x2^2) + β (x1  x2) ∈ J for some β∈ℂ. \\begin{equation*} \\overset{\\varphi}{\\longrightarrow} Hilb ^{Sn \\times \\mathbb{C} ^\\ast}{\\rho,h}(\\mathbb{C} ^n). \\end{equation*} 3, the role of (xixj)(xkxl) is played by (x1x2)(x1x3)(x2x3).

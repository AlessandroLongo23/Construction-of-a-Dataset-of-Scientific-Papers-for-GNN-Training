In the case that \u03c1 = M^\u03bb is a permutation module corresponding to certain special types of partitions \u03bb of n, we prove that _\u03c1^S_n(\u2102^n) is irreducible or even smooth. We also prove irreducibility whenever \u03c1\u2264 2n and the invariant Hilbert scheme is non-empty. In this same range, we classify all homogeneous symmetric ideals and decide which of these define singular points of _\u03c1^S_n(\u2102^n).

Special classes of symmetric ideals, for instance Specht ideals and Tanisaki ideals \\cite{Tanisaki1982Defining,BergeronGarsia1992Harmonic,GarsiaProcesi1992}, have been studied intensively in the algebraic combinatorics literature and are related to Kostka--Macdonald polynomials and the famous work of Haiman on n!, see \\cite{Haiman2003Combinatorics} and the references therein. In commutative algebra, symmetric ideals are mainly studied for their asymptotic properties. We refer to \\cite{Nagel2017Equivariant,Nagel2019FIvaryingCoeff,NagelRoemer2020CodimUpToSymmetry,NagelRoemer2021RegularityUpToSymmetry,nagpal2021symmetric} for plenty of examples as well as to \\cite{ChurchFarb2013RepresentationStability,ChurchEllenbergFarb2015FImodules} for foundational results on representation stability and FI-modules. One of the most well-known results on symmetric ideals is that an infinite chain of symmetric ideals I_n \u2286\u2102[x_1,\u2026,x_n] in increasingly many variables with I_n-1\u2286 I_n for all n eventually stabilizes in the sense that I_n = (S_n \u00b7 I_n-1) for all n large enough \\cite{Cohen1967Laws,Aschenbrenner2007Finite,Hillar2012Finite,Draisma2014Noetherianity}, where S_n is the symmetric group on n elements."

It can be obtained as the associated graded ideal of the vanishing ideal of the S_n-orbit of a point in \u2102^n whose entries occur with multiplicities \u03bb_1, \u03bb_2, and so on \\cite{GarsiaProcesi1992}. The closure of the set of these vanishing ideals is an irreducible component of _M^\u03bb^S_n(\u2102^n), the smoothable component. A natural question is therefore whether this is all there is, i.e., whether _M^\u03bb^S_n(\u2102^n) is irreducible. For certain types of partitions, for instance if \u03bb is a hook partition or has only two non-zero parts, we show that _M^\u03bb^S_n(\u2102^n) is indeed irreducible, see Corollary~\\ref{corollary:hookPartition}.

Distraction proves in particular that every irreducible component of the usual Hilbert scheme of points intersects the smoothable component. We do not know whether this is also true for _\u03c1 whenever \u03c1 is a direct sum of permutation modules. Let us note that a symmetric monomial ideal is rarely a torus-fixed point of _\u03c1.

Hence, if h is any monomial appearing in \u27e8 f, g \u27e9\u2208 P, we get \u27e8 hf, g \u27e9\u2260 0. But hf \u2208 I_d(\u03bb)\u2286 (I_\u03bb)_d(\u03bb), a contradiction. This shows that the Tanisaki ideal is the unique largest homogeneous symmetric ideal of P intersecting S^\u03bb\u2286 P_d(\u03bb) trivially, as mentioned in \\cite[p.~62]{Haiman2003Combinatorics}."

The final point is now that actually _\u2102(P/I_\u03bb) = n\u03bb (proved in~\\cite{BergeronGarsia1992Harmonic}, recalled in~\\cite[Lemma~3.4.17]{Haiman2003Combinatorics}), hence I = I_\u03bb.

Assume this is not true and there exists f \u2208 I \u2216 I_\u03bb. Write f = f_1 + f_2 + \u22ef as a sum of its homogeneous parts. Then there is a smallest degree d such that there exists some g \u2208 S^\u03bb\u2286 P_d(\u03bb) with \u27e8 f_d, g \u27e9\u2260 0.

Replacing f by hf \u2208 I \u2216 I_\u03bb we are now given a possibly inhomogeneous element f \u2208 I such that all homogeneous components of f except for f_d(\u03bb) annihilate S^\u03bb\u2286 P_d(\u03bb). Since S^\u03bb occurs in P only in degrees \u2265 d(\u03bb), the S_n-submodule of I generated by all permutations of f in particular contains a polynomial p = p_d(\u03bb) + p_d(\u03bb)+1 + \u22ef with 0 \u2260 p_d(\u03bb)\u2208 S^\u03bb\u2286 P_d(\u03bb) such that all permutations of p span an S_n-module isomorphic to S^\u03bb.

Therefore, we can eliminate all degree >d(\u03bb) terms of p with multiples of p itself, creating only new terms in strictly higher degrees. Since V(I) = {0}, there exists some N with \ud835\udd2a^N \u2286 I. Therefore, eventually, p_d(\u03bb)\u2208 I. But then, again by Lemma~\\ref{lem:higherSpecht}, I contains the entire Specht ideal of type \u03bb, hence P/I cannot contain any copy of S^\u03bb which contradicts P/I \u2245 M^\u03bb."

Fundamentally, the irreducible representations of G are exactly the tensor products of Specht modules \\mbox{S^\u03bd^1\u2297\u22ef\u2297 S^\u03bd^k}, \u03bd^i \u22a2 l_i.

Since the smoothable component has dimension m, it suffices to show that every other potential irreducible component has dimension \u2264 m. Since the Hilbert--Chow morphism is finite by Corollary~\\ref{corollary:HilbChowFinite}, the dimension of every irreducible component agrees with the dimension of its image. So it remains to prove that all partitions \u03bc for which the preimage of O(\u03bc)/S_n under the Hilbert--Chow morphism is non-empty have at most m parts. For this, let I \u2286 P be a symmetric ideal with P/I \u2245 M^\u03bb as S_n-modules and such that the S_n-orbit given by V(I) lies in O(\u03bc)/S_n. Then P/\u221a(I)\u2245 M^\u03bc and the canonical surjection P/I \u21a0 P/\u221a(I) is S_n-equivariant. Therefore, \u03bc\u22b5\u03bb. This in particular implies that the number of non-zero parts of \u03bc is at most m, as desired.     The remaining statement is precisely Proposition~\\ref{prop:HilbChowInjective}."

The Tanisaki ideal of \u03bc is the associated graded ideal to the S_n-orbit of any point a \u2208\u2102^n whose stabilizer in S_n is conjugate to the Young subgroup S_\u03bc \\cite{GarsiaProcesi1992}. To see the first inclusion let a_1,\u2026,a_m \u2208\u2102 be the distinct coordinates of a such that a_i occurs \u03bc_i times in a. Then for any 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m and any subset I\u2282 [n] of cardinality R_k(\u03bc) we have {a_i | i \u2208 I}\u2229{a_1\u2026,a_k}\u2260\u2205 by the pigeonhole principle. Thus the polynomial \u220f_i=1^R_k(\u03bc)\u220f_j=1^k(x_i-a_j) vanishes on the entire orbit S_n \u00b7{a}. Also \u220f_i=1^m(x_1-a_i) vanishes on the orbit. However, the top degree terms of those polynomials are precisely the monomial generators of the ideal I_\u03bc. This proves I_\u03bc\u2282 I_\u03bc. For the other inclusion, we note that for a \u2208\u2102^n we know that p_i-p_i(a) is contained in the vanishing ideal of S_n \u00b7{a} and the containment of _T with (T) \u03bc follows from \\cite[Corollary~1]{moustrou2021symmetric}."

Note that all unspecified indices in each appearing generator are meant to be distinct and run through all of [n]. The generators of the form (x_i-x_j)(x_k-x_l) must therefore be interpreted as only occurring for n \u2265 4 but not for n=3. To avoid redundancy in the table, for row~2 one should take r \u2265 n+3. For example, for r = n+2 the first ideal of row~2 is the same as that of row~5 for [a:b] = [-1:n]. Finally, the second ideal of row~7 has colength 7>2n for n=3, so we only consider it for n \u2265 4."

For smoothness one only has to check that the tangent space dimension agrees with the dimension of the smoothable component and argue that it contains the respective ideal which is the case for all ideals in Table~\\ref{tab:classification}.

We claim that equality holds. For this, observe that there is no linear dependence among the degree 2 generators of N_1 and that every homogeneous multiple of (x_i-x_j) and p_1^d-1 with strictly larger degree already lies in I. Therefore, there is no linear relation among the remaining \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3_d-1,\u03b4_1,\u2026,\u03b4_d-1 which actually involves at least one of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3_d-1. Therefore, the only possible linear relations are among \u03b4_1, \u2026, \u03b4_d-1. By what we have explained above, such a relation arises from a syzygy of the generators of N_1 such that the coefficient g of p_1^d is a homogeneous polynomial which is non-zero in P/I. If (g) \u2265 2, then after rescaling we have g = p_1^k  I for some 2 \u2264 k \u2264 d-1. But such a syzygy does not exist since no power p_1^k (including k = 0 and k = 1) is contained in (x_i - x_j)_\u2265 2. Therefore, the only case left is g \u2208\u27e8 x_i - x_j \u27e9. But this gives precisely the relation we have already used above to show \u03b4_0 = 0. This proves _\u2102(^S_n_P(I,P/I)) = d+2."

For this, let a, b, c_2, c_3, \u2026, c_d \u2208\u2102 such that a \u2260 b and c_2, c_3, \u2026, c_d are all distinct. Define J_(a,b,c_2,c_3,\u2026,c_d) to be the vanishing ideal of the points given by the S_n-orbit of (b,a,a,\u2026,a) and the d-1 diagonal points (c_2,\u2026, c_2), \u2026, (c_d, \u2026, c_d). The product of the d polynomials p_1 - ((n-1)a + b) and p_1 - n c_i clearly lies in J, and its top degree part is precisely p_1^d. Also, for all degree 2 generators of N_1 except for p_1^2 - np_2 there is a polynomial in J whose top degree part is precisely this generator. This is evidenced by the polynomials (x_i - x_j)(x_i + x_j - (a+b)), (x_i - x_j)(p_1 - ((n-1)a + b)) and (x_i - x_j)(x_k - x_l). Fixing c_2, \u2026, c_d and letting (a,b) tend to (0,0) linearly, i.e., along the family (ta,tb), we obtain the ideal J_(c_2,\u2026,c_d) = ((p_1) + \ud835\udd2a^2) \u2229_(c_2,\u2026,c_2)\u2229\u22ef\u2229_(c_d,\u2026,c_d). For all distinct c_2, \u2026, c_d, this ideal therefore lies in the smoothable component. Moreover, it still contains the above polynomials with (a,b) replaced by (0,0). We claim that J_(c_2,\u2026,c_d) also contains p_1^2 - n p_2. But this is clear since this polynomial is obviously contained in (p_1) + \ud835\udd2a^2 and vanishes on all diagonal points. Hence, letting (c_2, \u2026, c_d) tend to (0,\u2026, 0) linearly, i.e., along the family (tc_2,\u2026, tc_d) which lies entirely in the smoothable component, the limiting ideal contains p_1^2 - np_2 and all the above polynomials with all parameters replaced by 0, which is a generating set for I. Therefore, this limiting ideal must be I itself, and hence I lies in the smoothable component."

In case [a:b] = [-1:n], I is the ideal of Row~2(a) with d = 3, so we know that this point is singular. We claim that I is a smooth point for all different [a:b]. The point here is that the 2-dimensional torus T fixes this 1-dimensional set of ideals, and there are precisely two T-fixed points, namely [a:b] = [-1:n] and [a:b] = [1:0]. It is therefore enough to prove that the ideal obtained for [a:b] = [1:0] corresponds to a smooth point of _\u03c1. First, we note that (p_1^2,p_1(x_i - x_j)) = (p_1)_\u2265 2, hence \ud835\udd2a^3 is already contained in I = (p_1^2,p_1(x_i-x_j),x_i^2-x_j^2,(x_i-x_j)(x_k-x_l)), as was the case in Row~4(b). Hence, we can choose the generators of I as an S_n-stable basis for N_1. Moreover, \u03c1 = P/I = \u27e8 1 \u27e9\u2295\u27e8 p_1 \u27e9\u2295\u27e8 p_2 \u27e9\u2295\u27e8 x_i-x_j \u27e9 = 3S^(n)\u2295 S^(n-1,1). Hence, any f \u2208^S_n_P(I,P/I) has the form"

Applying the transposition (i,j) to this polynomial yields -(x_i - x_j)(x_k - x_l) + (i,j)(\u2113) + c \u2208 J, hence the sum must lie in J as well, and equals \u2113 + (i,j)(\u2113) + 2c. It follows that \u2113 = \u03bb (x_i - x_j) for some \u03bb\u2208\u2102 and that c = 0. For the same reason, we also get \u2113 = \u03bc (x_k - x_l) for some \u03bc\u2208\u2102, hence \u2113 = 0.

But which parameters a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2 do then actually give us an ideal J of the correct colength? Clearly, the associated graded of J contains \ud835\udd2a^2 for every choice of parameters. But equality need not hold in general; the obstruction are linear forms contained in J. These linear forms, however, can only arise from syzygies of the monomial generators of \ud835\udd2a^2 in degree~3, i.e., from the identities x_i^2 x_j = x_i (x_i x_j) and (x_i x_j) x_k = x_i (x_j x_k). Using these, we obtain all possible linear forms contained in J. Their coefficients yield 3 linearly independent homogeneous polynomials F_1,F_2,F_3 of degree 2 in a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2. The coefficients of the F_i, in turn, are integer constants or linear polynomials in n. Treating n as a variable, we consider the ideal (F_1,F_2,F_3) in the polynomial ring \u211a[a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,n]. A computation in \\texttt{Macaulay2} then provides the minimal primes of this ideal (over \u211a). They are \ud835\udd2d_1  (a_1,b_1,a_2-b_2) and \ud835\udd2d_2  (b_2+a_1+(n-1)a_2, a_1^2 + (n-2)a_1 a_2 + a_2 b_1). Both are geometrically prime, i.e., prime over \u2102, even if n is regarded as an integer again. The first prime ideal \ud835\udd2d_1 only parametrizes ideals defining a subscheme of \u2102^n for which the origin is not reduced. Precisely, apart from \ud835\udd2a^2 itself, the members of the family defined by \ud835\udd2d_1 have the form ((p_1) + \ud835\udd2a^2) \u2229_(c,c,\u2026,c) for some c \u2208\u2102\u2216{0}. We have already seen that these ideals all lie in the smoothable component. The flat family defined by \ud835\udd2d_2 must then contain, in particular, the set of all symmetric ideals whose associated graded is \ud835\udd2a^2 and which define a subscheme of \u2102^n for which the origin is a reduced point. Now, the general radical ideal in _\u03c1 has associated graded equal to \ud835\udd2a^2, and the subset whose vanishing set contains the origin has dimension 2. On the other hand, (\u2102[a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2]/\ud835\udd2d_2) = 2 as well. Therefore, by irreducibility, every member of the family defined by \ud835\udd2d_2 is smoothable, concluding the argument."

To see this, note that the vanishing set of a symmetric ideal J whose associated graded is I, which is not radical and whose vanishing set does not contain a diagonal point must consist of precisely one orbit generated by (b,a,a,\u2026,a) for a \u2260 b. Every point must have multiplicity 2 by symmetry and since _\u2102(P/J) = 2n. The stabilizer of the subscheme of (P/J) supported at a single point, say (b,a,a,\u2026,a) is precisely S_n-1, embedded into S_n as the permutations fixing the first index. Since its multiplicity is 2, the subscheme supported at (b,a,a,\u2026,a) is defined by the ideal ((x_1-b)^2, x_2 - a, \u2026, x_n - a), so that J is the intersection of all permutations of this ideal. However, this is impossible since the associated graded then would not contain p_1(x_1-x_2) as can be checked after reducing to a=0 via the additive group action."

Note that the target of \u03c6 consists precisely of the ideals in Row~7(c), so it is irreducible of dimension~1.  all fibers of \u03c6 over closed points corresponding to homogeneous ideals I' have a component of dimension at least 3 containing I'. Indeed, for any such ideal in Row~7(c) other than I itself consider the vanishing ideal J of two distinct orbits represented by (b,a,a,\u2026,a) and (d,c,c,\u2026,c), a \u2260 b, c \u2260 d.

This shows that J belongs to Row~7(c). Conversely, given any \u03b1\u2208\u2102, the existence of \u03b2 such that the above polynomial belongs to J defines exactly one linear condition on a,b,c,d.

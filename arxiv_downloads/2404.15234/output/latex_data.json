However, while deep learning models evolve to become more capable and computational power keeps increasing, the datasets available are being retracted and removed from public access. Privacy and ethical concerns are relevant topics within these domains. Through generative artificial intelligence, researchers have put efforts into the development of completely synthetic datasets that can be used to train face recognition systems. Nonetheless, the recent advances have not been sufficient to achieve performance comparable to the stateoftheart models trained on real data. To study the drift between the performance of models trained on real and synthetic datasets, we leverage a massive attribute classifier (MAC) to create annotations for four datasets: two real and two synthetic. From these annotations, we conduct studies on the distribution of each attribute within all four datasets. Additionally, we further inspect the differences between real and synthetic datasets on the attribute set. When comparing through the Kullback–Leibler divergence we have found differences between real and synthetic samples. Interestingly enough, we have verified that while real samples suffice to explain the synthetic distribution, the opposite could not be further from being true.",

Moreover, a dataset that is composed of real images with proper curation and consent is not static, since according to the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), consent can be removed at any time.

These former models seem to perform considerably worse on certain ethnicities and other variations of the traditional face verification setting, such as crosspose or crossage. This behaviour can be sustained by several factors, and Huber~et al. has already explored the diversity of synthetic datasets with regards to gender, ethnicity, age and head position. We firmly believe that the diversity of face datasets can be further described by other attributes. The work of Terhörst et al. aims to create datasets that are annotated for 47 distinct attributes, which can be leveraged to highlight differences between synthetic and real datasets.

Low variability of some characteristics can make models trained on that dataset less robust to applications on realworld data, where inference on examples with such characteristics is necessary. With this information, it is also possible to explore, disclose, and correct demographic biases, addressing fairness concerns. The process of annotating manually is labourintensive, which can be unfeasible for large datasets. Some works have proposed classificationbased estimation of softbiometric characteristics which can aid the annotation of large datasets: Karkkainen et al. (ethnicity, gender, age), GonzalezSosa et al. (gender, age, craniofacial features, skin colour, subjective annotation),Mirabet~et al. (hidden face attributes), Merler et al. (gender, age, glasses, beard, and moustache), Terhörst et al. (47 attribute annotations covering gender, ethnicity, age, accessories, facial hair, hairstyles, subjective annotation, and other facial characteristics). Following the completeness of the 47 attributes generated by the model proposed by Terhörst et al., it presents itself as the ideal approach to studying the broad diversity of synthetic datasets. A similar annotation approach has been followed for DeepFake datasets, and through the analysis of such annotations it was possible to understand and detect certain biases on DeepFake detection systems. This further highlights the importance of having this information available.",

For each plot, the top seven attributes are the ones that are more in line when the two datasets are compared, whereas the bottom seven are the most dissimilar. Some attributes are frequently displayed in the dissimilar set: Square Face, Male, No Beard and Smiling. In the synthetic data, samples are generally more skewed towards being female, whereas in real data the opposite happens. Probably related to this prevalence, there are significantly fewer samples with beards on synthetic datasets. Although it seems a minor issue, the beard represents one of the most natural and common forms of face occlusions. One other relevant aspect is the inability to properly detect smiles on synthetic data, as the majority of the annotations are ''Undefined\". This might impact the variability of the samples as the emotions/face reactions are one of the elements that most affect the perception of a face. One additional relevant element is the presence of White as one of the most dissimilar attribute distributions when the real dataset is BalancedFace. While this dataset focuses on balancing the different skin tones, synthetic datasets contain mostly white individuals.",

What we can verify is the difference in the dispersion of these differences, meaning that some attributes have more extreme fluctuations. We also noted that the attributes that have the highest decrease in the proportion of Undefined when compared to a Real dataset were consistently attributes related to facial hair (such as 'oclockshadow', 'nobeard', 'sideburns', 'goatee' ). This is consistent with a balancing of the gender attribute in the synthetic dataset, since prediction for these attributes tends to be easier in the 'female' class. On the other hand attributes that consistently have an increase in unpredictability include 'smiling' and accessory use such as 'wearing lipstick' and 'wearing earrings'. Emotions and their expressions might be particularly difficult to model with a generative system, as well as artifacts such as accessories.

Afterwards, as seen in Table~, we have measured the Kullback–Leibler divergence for all combinations of datasets. When P is set to the distribution of GlobalFace, we noticed that both SynGAN and CPD25 as Q lead to significant information loss. On the other hand, BalancedFace as Q allows for diminished information loss. Setting BalancedFace as P leads to very similar results with a synthetic Q, but considerably better than the previous comparison. On the other hand, GlobalFace is quite accurate at approximating the other real datasets. Both synthetic datasets can be easily explained by the other datasets, leading to very small values of information loss. This discrepancy in the KL values highlights the lack of diversity shown in synthetic datasets for face recognition and how they must improve to replace real data.",

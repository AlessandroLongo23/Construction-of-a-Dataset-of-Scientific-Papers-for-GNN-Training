To achieve a better performance, we ask GPT4 to generate 1K highquality summarizations, and distilled those samples to train our own Mixtral summarizer.

Since we leverage LLMs to perform cluster summarization, and models can extract and summarize to generate any information, similar values may appear in different forms, for instance, ''Aboriginal Australians'' and ''Indigenous Australians'' are synonyms, and ''fashion and attire'' and ''clothing'' are two similar topics. Having such synonyms makes it hard to query and manage our dataset, so we normalize values in the two fields of ''cultural group'' and ''topic'', to collapse synonyms. Similar to the previous clustering step, we use HAC to group synonyms in cultural groups together and take the majority vote as the representative cultural group. Grouping together similar topics turns out to be a more involved task, as many topics overlap with and differ from each other in subtle ways, so embeddingbased clustering methods (e.g., HAC) often yield noisy results that fail to align with human judgements. Instead, we use an LLM to detect 100 recurring themes from our original topics, and then manually merge, prune, and rephrase these themes into 36 highlevel cultural topics. Finally, we ask an LLM to classify each summarized cluster into one of these topics. Table~ shows the details of our final list of 36 cultural topics.",

Your role is to follow the given instructions precisely and format your responses as required. Keep your responses succinct and limited to the requested information. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information. Cultural information encompasses content that showcases the distinctive characteristics, artifacts, or manifestations of a specific group, community, or region. This includes, but is not limited to, practices, behaviors, norms, values, beliefs, habits, customs, architectural styles, environmental engagements, and any other elements that are emblematic of a particular cultural setting. It does not include generic information or widespread practices that are not distinctly tied to a specific cultural identity. For this task, consider information as \"cultural\" if: 1. It is associated with or characteristic of a specific identified group (e.g., Americans, Italians, midwestern Americans, etc.). 2. It reveals a unique aspect of that group's way of life, including social conventions, physical creations, or interactions with their surroundings that are not typically seen in other cultures. 3. It provides insight into the cultural uniqueness, whether through social practices, material culture, or other culturally significant elements. Please exclude generic or ubiquitous statements or observations that do not clearly relate to the unique cultural context of a specific group. <</SYS>> For each videocomment pair, you need to do two things: 1. Determine whether the provided example contains cultural information. 2. If the example does include cultural information, extract the cultural knowledge into a list of JSON objects with the following fields: ''' { \"cultural group\": \"group of people with the same cultural background\", \"context\": \"location, or other settings this behavior is performed\", \"goal\": \"goal of the behavior\", \"relation\": \"relation between the actor and recipient\", \"actor\": \"the actor of the action\", \"recipient\": \"the recipient of the action\", \"actor's behavior\": \"the behavior of the actor\", \"recipient's behavior\": \"the behavior of the recipient\", \"other descriptions\": \"any other description that doesn't fit into previous categories\", \"topic\": \"cultural topic\", \"norm\": \"whether the described event is considered norm according to the given comment. 1 = norm; 0 = taboo\", } ''' If an example contains multiple cultural knowledge, please encode each piece of knowledge into a seperate JSON object. Output the extracted cultural knowledge as a list of JSON objects, or an empty list if the provided example does not contain any cultural information.  Here are some examples: {fewshotexamples}  Now determine if the following example contains cultural information and extract any cultrual knowledge into a list of JSON objects. Please only include information that you directly extract from the provided text and do not hallucinate. [Reminder]: Consider information as \"cultural\" if: 1. It pertains to a specific identified group (e.g., Americans, Italians). 2. It shows unique cultural traits or practices of that group differing from others. 3. It provides insight into the cultural uniqueness, whether through social practices, material culture, or other culturally significant elements. Please avoid considering generic statements or behaviors that are common across multiple cultures or lack specificity as \"cultural information.\" Please base your answers strictly on the provided text. If important cultural context, such as the cultural group, is not explicitly mentioned or directly inferable from the text, output an empty list. Avoid adding or assuming any information that is not directly supported by the text. Once you've outputed a list of JSON objects, please immediately output \"<EOD>\".

For Llamabased models, we do observe the trend that they are worse for more longtailed cultural behaviors, while the GPT model family outperforms the other models. Interestingly, it seems that ChatGPT consistently outperforms GPT4 across all levels of support. Qualitative analysis found that it is partially because there is often times no cleancut thresholds on whether a cultural behavior is a common practice, and in ambiguous cases GPT4 tends to behave more conservatively, and this demonstrates one major limitation of such a simplistic approach of direct evaluation. Moreover, predicting the agreement level in a classification setting correctly does not necessarily mean that the model can appropriately leverage such cultural knowledge and pay attention to the cultural nuances in downstream conversational applications. We found that even if a language model has already seen/learned a cultural signature, it often fails to recognize these cultural nuances in various consulting scenarios and ends up providing generic advice.

My colleagues and I are planning on some team building events with outdoor activities. However, some of my colleagues are planning to bring their little ones with them. It's quite chilly outside, and some of the kids are really young. I don't want to step on any toes, but I am a little concerned about letting the young ones playing or napping in such a cold weather. What should I do? \\bottomrule \\end{tabularx} Another example of the generated scenario, persona, and question grounded on a cultural descriptor."

Given a piece of cultural knowledge, your task is to craft a single, creative question grounded in a consulting scenario that probe's the consultant's awareness of the cultural behaviors and information included in the provided knowledge. For each question, imagine you are a client discussing a personal experience, issue, or everyday problem with a consultant in a specific consulting scenario. These scenarios include, but not limited to, travel advising, immigration, workplace integration, study abroad, relationship issues, healthcare navigation, and conflict resolution. In particular, when generating each question, you should: 1. Choose a consulting scenario 2. Generate a persona for the client 3. Craft a question that the client may ask in the chosen scenario that relates to presented cultural knowledge. Keep the following guidelines in mind: 1. Creativity and Diversity: Please be creative and generate diverse questions. Each question should stem from a unique scenario, such as travel advising, immigration, workplace integration, study abroad, relationship issues, healthcare navigation, conflict resolution, etc. Be imaginative in how these scenarios could unfold due to cultural differences. 2. Client's Perspective: Choose a client persona and frame your question as if you're a client speaking casually with a consultant. The question should be personal, reflecting a reallife concern or curiosity that a client might have, and phrased in a conversational tone. 3. Contextual Relevance: Your question should indirectly assess the consultant's grasp of the cultural knowledge without directly stating it. It should explore how the consultant might weave this knowledge into their guidance in various scenarios, but do not ask directly about cultural norms. 4. Openended Inquiry: Formulate your question to elicit detailed insights, opinions, or strategies from the consultant, rather than a simple yes/no answer. Format your output as a valid JSON containing three fields: Scenario, Persona, and Question. Do not include any additional words.  Knowledge: {culturalknowledgedescription} Craft a question about a reallife scenario or concern that **subtly** and **indirectly** relates to the given knowledge. Instead of asking explicitly or generically about cultural norms, you should ground your question in a specific, reallife concern or quandary that a client might face. Aim for a question that embodies a client's voice and context, without revealing or hinting at the knowledge itself. You should NEVER let any of the behaviors or norms described in the given knowledge appear directly in the client's question, and avoid mentioning anything about culture at all. Instead, use anecdotes from the client's perspective. Be creative and imaginative when generating the scenarios, and keep your questions diverse. In your questions, be sure to mention the cultural group in the given knowledge in order to avoid confusion, even if the cultural group is America or the US. Format your output as a valid json.

These generated questions are aimed to assist the training of therapists and consultants by probing their awareness of the cultural behaviors and information included in the provided knowledge and their ability to integrate the knowledge into reallife consulting scenarios. Each question is generated based on the following guidelines: 1. Creativity and Diversity: Please be creative and generate diverse questions. Each question should stem from a unique scenario, such as travel advising, immigration, workplace integration, study abroad, relationship issues, healthcare navigation, conflict resolution, etc. Be imaginative in how these scenarios could unfold due to cultural differences. 2. Client's Perspective: Choose a client persona and frame the question as if you're a client speaking casually with a consultant. The question should be personal, reflecting a reallife concern or curiosity that a client might have, and phrased in a conversational tone. 3. Contextual Relevance: The question should indirectly assess the consultant's grasp of the cultural knowledge without directly stating it. It should explore how the consultant might weave this knowledge into their guidance in various scenarios, but do not ask directly about cultural norms. 4. Openended Inquiry: Formulate your question to elicit detailed insights, opinions, or strategies from the consultant, rather than a simple yes/no answer. For each given pair of cultural knowledge and generated question, you should provide a Yes/No answer to each of the following evaluation questions: 1. Is the generated question relevant to the given knowledge? Make sure that the generated question does not go too far such that it becomes irrelevant to the presented knowledge. 2. Does the generated question **indirectly** refer to the given knowledge? Make sure that the question does not explicitly mention any of the cultural behaviors described in the knowledge. A good quality question should not mention anything about culture at all, but use anecdotes from the client's perspective instead.

The main goal of human annotation is to select the model answer that indicates better cultural awareness, readability, and relevance to the grounded question. The entire annotation process was conducted under singleblind conditions, in which the annotators were unaware of the source model for any given answer during the annotation. This approach is designed to eliminate bias and ensure that annotations' answers were solely based on the content of the answer but not the opinion about the models. Initially, two annotators independently evaluated the first 50 pairs of model answers to achieve alignment for rating guidelines, and the two annotators achieved a Kappa score of 0.87, which indicated a high agreement between the annotators. Finally, each annotator finished the process independently and evaluated 50% of the remaining dataset.",

Here are some tips to help you enjoy European dairy delicacies responsibly and safely while being mindful of your health and the local culture: 1. **Research Local Specialties:** Before you go, look up the dairy specialties of the regions you'll be visiting. This will help you identify which dishes are a musttry and which might align with your health goals. 2. **Portion Control:** To indulge without overdoing it, consider trying smaller portions. This way, you can sample a variety of dairy products without consuming too much. 3. **Balance Your Diet:** When you're planning your meals, balance rich dairy treats with other food groups, particularly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This can help maintain a healthy diet while traveling. 4. **Stay Hydrated:** Rich foods can be taxing on your digestive system, so make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. 5. **Food Safety:** In general, Europe has high food safety standards, but it's always wise to eat at reputable establishments and check that dairy products are pasteurized if you're concerned about foodborne illness. 6. **Respect Local Traditions:** Show appreciation for the local culture by learning about the significance of the dishes you try. This might also give you insight into the best ways to enjoy them. 7. **Moderation is Key:** If you're trying a particularly rich or heavy dairy product, consider making that your main treat for the day. 8. **Active Travel:** Balance your food indulgences with physical activity. Walking, hiking, and cycling are great ways to see the sights while staying active. 9. **Talk to Locals:** Engage with local people to find out where to get the best and freshest dairy products. They can also provide tips on how to enjoy them in moderation. 10. **Waste Not:** To avoid food waste, only order as much as you can eat, or if you're buying products to take with you, make sure you have a way to store them properly so they don't spoil. Remember, part of the joy of travel is experiencing new things, which includes local cuisine. Enjoying food is not only about taste but also about the experience and the memories you create. Bon voyage and happy tasting!} \\midrule \\parbox[t]{2cm}{Our Model's Response} & \\parbox[t]{\\dimexpr\\textwidth2cm4\\tabcolsep}{Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you navigate this delicious dilemma! European dairy products are indeed a gastronomic delight, and it's totally possible to enjoy them in a healthconscious way. Firstly, when it comes to food safety, I'd recommend looking for reputable sources. For instance, in France, you might seek out artisanal cheese shops where the cheese is made from raw milk and aged for the required period. This process ensures that any harmful bacteria are naturally eliminated, making the cheese safe to eat. Similarly, in Italy, you'll find that Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto di Parma, both DOP (Protected Designation of Origin) products, undergo rigorous production standards that ensure their safety. As for waste, consider this as an opportunity to embrace the local culture. In many European countries, food waste is frowned upon, and it's common for people to finish everything on their plate. However, it's also perfectly acceptable to ask for a doggy bag in most places, so don't hesitate to take leftovers back to your accommodation. Lastly, remember that these are treats, not everyday foods. While it's okay to indulge, moderation is key. Enjoy these delicacies as part of a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. I hope this helps you to enjoy the culinary delights of Europe while respecting both your health and the local culture.

Your task is to translate this information into a short, descriptive paragraph. The provided cultural knowledge is encoded as a JSON object with the following fields: {culturaldescriptorfielddefinitions} Your task is to translate this information into a short, descriptive paragraph. Please adhere to the following guidelines: 1. Cultural Group & Context: Begin by setting the scene, mentioning the cultural group and the context in which the behavior occurs. 2. Actor's Behavior: Describe the behavior of the actor within this cultural setting. If the behavior aims to achieve a specific goal, mention this as well. 3. Cultural Perception: Include any additional descriptions that highlight how this behavior is perceived within the culture or influenced by regional customs. 4. Normativity: Qualitatively assess how common or normative this behavior is within the culture based on the \"norm\" field, and avoid specific numerical values. Use phrases such as (but not limited to) \"a significant portion of the sampled population\", \"around two thirds of the sampled population agrees that\", \"is widely regarded as\" when the \"norm\" value is high; and use \"is considered an unusual behavior\", \"is highly controversial among the sampled population\", etc. if the \"norm\" value is low. 5. Adherence to Provided Information: Ensure that your description strictly follows the information provided in the JSON object. Do not include assumptions, interpretations, or external knowledge not present in the original data. Your output should be no more than 150 words. User Prompt: Here is a piece of cultural knowledge encoded in a JSON object:\" {jsonculturaldescriptor} Based on the provided information, craft a paragraph that encapsulates the essence of the cultural knowledge, ensuring each point above is addressed where applicable. Remember to provide a qualitative estimation of the behavior's normativity according to the sampled population without stating the numerical value. Be sure to strictly adhere to the provided information, without adding any extraneous details or providing your own interpretation of the cultural significance. Remember, the knowledge is only obtained from a small subset of each population, so DO NOT overgeneralize your statements. Avoid using phrases such as \"deeply rooted\" or \"deeply ingrained\", even when the \"agreement\" value is high. Limit your response to 150 words.",

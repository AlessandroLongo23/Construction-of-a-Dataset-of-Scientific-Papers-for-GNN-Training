abstract = {The quality and nature of knowledge that can be found by an automated knowledge-extraction system depends on its inputs. For systems that learn by reading text, the Web offers a breadth of topics and currency, but it also presents the problems of dealing with casual, unedited writing, non-textual inputs, and the mingling of languages. The results of extraction using the KNEXT system on two Web corpora - Wikipedia and a collection of weblog entries - indicate that, with automatic filtering of the output, even ungrammatical writing on arbitrary topics can yield an extensive knowledge base, which human judges find to be of good quality, with propositions receiving an average score across both corpora of 2.34 (where the range is 1 to 5 and lower is better) versus 3.00 for unfiltered output from the same sources.},

abstract="Cultural differences play a very important role in matching computer interfaces to the expectations of users from different national and cultural backgrounds. But to date, there has been little systematic research as to the extent of such differences, and how to produce software that automatically takes into account these differences. We are studying these issues using a unique resource: Common Sense knowledge bases in different languages. Our research points out that this kind of knowledge can help computer systems to consider cultural differences. We describe our experiences with knowledge bases containing thousands of sentences describing people and everyday activities, collected from volunteer Web contributors in three different cultures: Brazil, Mexico and the USA, and software which automatically searches for cultural differences amongst the three cultures, alerting the user to potential differences.",

To assess factual knowledge retrieval in LMs in different languages, we create a multilingual benchmark of cloze-style probes for typologically diverse languages. To properly handle language variations, we expand probing methods from single- to multi-word entities, and develop several decoding algorithms to generate multi-token predictions. Extensive experimental results provide insights about how well (or poorly) current state-of-the-art LMs perform at this task in languages with more or fewer available resources. We further propose a code-switching-based method to improve the ability of multilingual LMs to access knowledge, and verify its effectiveness on several benchmark languages. Benchmark data and code have be released at \url{https://x-factr.github.io}.",

% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sec1}
% In the past two decades, there has been important progress in developing adaptive mesh methods for PDEs.
% Mesh adaptivity is usually of two types in form: local mesh refinement and moving mesh method.  ....

% \section{Preparation of Manuscript}
% \label{sec2}
% The Title Page should contain the article title, authors' names and complete affiliations,
% and email addresses of all authors. The Abstract should provide a brief summary of the main findings of the paper.

% References should be cited in the text by a number in square brackets.
% Literature cited should appear on a separate page at the end of the article
% and should be styled and punctuated using standard abbreviations for journals
% (see Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index, 1989). For unpublished lectures of symposia,
% include title of paper, name of sponsoring society in full, and date.
% Give titles of unpublished reports with "(unpublished)" following the reference.
% Only articles that have been published or are in press should be included in the references.
% Unpublished results or personal communications should be cited as such in the text.
% Please note the sample at the end of this paper.

% Equations should be typewritten whenever possible and the number placed in parentheses at the right margin.
% Reference to equations should use the form "Eq. (2.1)" or simply "(2.1)." Superscripts and subscripts should
% be typed or handwritten clearly above and below the line, respectively.

% Figures should be in a finished form suitable for publication. Number figures consecutively with Arabic numerals.
% Lettering on drawings should be of professional quality or generated by high-resolution computer graphics and must be
% large enough to withstand appropriate reduction for publication.
% For example, if you use {\sf MATLAB} to do figure plots,
% axis labels should be at least point 18. Title should be 24 points or above. Tick marks labels
% better have 14 points or above. Line width should be 2 (or above).

% Illustrations in color in most cases can be accepted
% only if the authors defray the cost. At the Editor's discretion a limited number of color figures each year of special
% interest will be published at no cost to the author\cite{arrowhead2017}.

  abstract = {In this paper we study time-splitting spectral approximations for the linear Schrödinger equation in the semiclassical regime, where the Planck constant ϵ is small. In this regime, the equation propagates oscillations with a wavelength of O(ϵ), and finite difference approximations require the spatial mesh size h=o(ϵ) and the time step k=o(ϵ) in order to obtain physically correct observables. Much sharper mesh-size constraints are necessary for a uniform L2-approximation of the wave function. The spectral time-splitting approximation under study will be proved to be unconditionally stable, time reversible, and gauge invariant. It conserves the position density and gives uniform L2-approximation of the wave function for k=o(ϵ) and h=O(ϵ). Extensive numerical examples in both one and two space dimensions and analytical considerations based on the Wigner transform e ven show that weaker constraints (e.g., k independent of ϵ, and h=O(ϵ)) are admissible for obtaining “correct” observables. Finally, we address the application to nonlinear Schrödinger equations and conduct some numerical experiments to predict the corresponding admissible meshing strategies.},

In preparation for the numerics we scale the 3d Gross–Pitaevskii equation and obtain a four-parameter model. Identifying ‘extreme parameter regimes’, the model is accessible to analytical perturbation theory, which justifies formal procedures well known in the physical literature: reduction to 2d and 1d GPEs, approximation of ground state solutions of the GPE and geometrical optics approximations. Then we use a time-splitting spectral method to discretize the time-dependent GPE. Again, perturbation theory is used to understand the discretization scheme and to choose the spatial/temporal grid in dependence of the perturbation parameter. Extensive numerical examples in 1d, 2d and 3d for weak/strong interactions, defocusing/focusing nonlinearity, and zero/nonzero initial phase data are presented to demonstrate the power of the numerical method and to discuss the physics of Bose–Einstein condensation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a continuous normalized gradient flow (CNGF) and prove its energy diminishing property, which provides a mathematical justification of the imaginary time method used in the physics literature to compute the ground state solution of Bose--Einstein condensates (BEC). We also investigate the energy diminishing property for the discretization of the CNGF. Two numerical methods are proposed for such discretizations: one is the backward Euler centered finite difference (BEFD) method, the other is an explicit time-splitting sine-spectral (TSSP) method. Energy diminishing for BEFD and TSSP for the linear case and monotonicity for BEFD for both linear and nonlinear cases are proven. Comparison between the two methods and existing methods, e.g., Crank--Nicolson finite difference (CNFD) or forward Euler finite difference (FEFD), shows that BEFD and TSSP are much better in terms of preserving the energy diminishing property of the CNGF. Numerical results in one, two, and three dimensions with magnetic trap confinement potential, as well as a potential of a stirrer corresponding to a far-blue detuned Gaussian laser beam, are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of BEFD and TSSP methods. Furthermore we observe that the CNGF and its BEFD discretization can also be applied directly to compute the first excited state solution in BEC when the initial data is chosen as an odd function.},

  abstract = {We establish uniform error estimates of finite difference methods for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) perturbed by the wave operator (NLSW) with a perturbation strength described by a dimensionless parameter \$\varepsilon\$ (\$\varepsilon\in(0,1]\$). When \$\varepsilon\to0^+\$, NLSW collapses to the standard NLS. In the small perturbation parameter regime, i.e., \$0<\varepsilon\ll1\$, the solution of NLSW is perturbed from that of NLS with a function oscillating in time with \$O(\varepsilon^2)\$-wavelength at \$O(\varepsilon^4)\$ and \$O(\varepsilon^2)\$ amplitudes for well-prepared and ill-prepared initial data, respectively. This high oscillation of the solution in time brings significant difficulties in establishing error estimates uniformly in \$\varepsilon\$ of the standard finite difference methods for NLSW, such as the conservative Crank–Nicolson finite difference (CNFD) method, and the semi-implicit finite difference (SIFD) method. We obtain error bounds uniformly in \$\varepsilon\$, at the order of \$O(h^2+\tau)\$ and \$O(h^2+\tau^{2/3})\$ with time step \$\tau\$ and mesh size h for well-prepared and ill-prepared initial data, respectively, for both CNFD and SIFD in the \$l^2\$-norm and discrete semi-\$H^1\$ norm. Our error bounds are valid for general nonlinearity in NLSW and for one, two, and three dimensions. To derive these uniform error bounds, we combine \$\varepsilon\$-dependent error estimates of NLSW, \$\varepsilon\$-dependent error bounds between the numerical approximate solutions of NLSW and the solution of NLS, together with error bounds between the solutions of NLSW and NLS. Other key techniques in the analysis include the energy method, cut-off of the nonlinearity, and a posterior bound of the numerical solutions by using the inverse inequality and discrete semi-\$H^1\$ norm estimate. Finally, numerical results are reported to confirm our error estimates of the numerical methods and show that the convergence rates are sharp in the respective parameter regimes.},

We begin with a review of dark and bright solitons of NLSE with defocusing and focusing cubic nonlinearities, respectively. For computing dark solitons, to overcome the nonzero and/or non-rest (or highly oscillatory) phase background at far field, we design efficient and accurate numerical methods based on accurate and simple artificial boundary conditions or a proper transformation to rest the highly oscillatory phase background. Stability and conservation laws of these numerical methods are analyzed. For computing interactions between dark and bright solitons, we compare the efficiency and accuracy of the above numerical methods and different existing numerical methods for computing bright solitons of NLSE, and identify the most efficient and accurate numerical methods for computing dark and bright solitons as well as their interactions in NLSE. These numerical methods are applied to study numerically the stability and interactions of dark and bright solitons in NLSE. Finally, they are extended to solve NLSE with general nonlinearity and/or external potential and coupled NLSEs with vector solitons.},

 abstract = {We introduce a new multiscale finite element method which is able to accurately capture solutions of elliptic interface problems with high contrast coefficients by using only coarse quasiuniform meshes, and without resolving the interfaces. A typical application would be the modelling of flow in a porous medium containing a number of inclusions of low (or high) permeability embedded in a matrix of high (respectively low) permeability. Our method is H¹- conforming, with degrees of freedom at the nodes of a triangular mesh and requiring the solution of subgrid problems for the basis functions on elements which straddle the coefficient interface but which use standard linear approximation otherwise. A key point is the introduction of novel coefficient-dependent boundary conditions for the subgrid problems. Under moderate assumptions, we prove that our methods have (optimal) convergence rate of O(h) in the energy norm and O(h²) in the L₂ norm where h is the (coarse) mesh diameter and the hidden constants in these estimates are independent of the "contrast" (i.e. ratio of largest to smallest value) of the PDE coefficient. For standard elements the best estimate in the energy norm would be ${\cal O}(h^{1/2-\varepsilon \})$ with a hidden constant which in general depends on the contrast. The new interior boundary conditions depend not only on the contrast of the coefficients, but also on the angles of intersection of the interface with the element edges.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a fast multipole-accelerated integral equation method for solving the modified Helmholtz equation Δu(x→)-β2u(x→)=f(x→) in two dimensions. The method is direct, and unlike classical FFT based fast solvers, it allows for adaptive mesh refinement but with comparable amount of work per grid point. When the computational domain is rectangular, Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic, and free-space boundary conditions can be imposed analytically without the need to solve a system of linear equations. Several important features of the algorithm are discussed, including the use of precomputed tables, diagonal translation operators, and lattice sums to impose periodic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments show that, for a wide range of the parameter β, the algorithm is stable and high-order accurate.},

  abstract = {To study ion transport in electrolyte solutions, we propose numerical methods for a modified Poisson–Nernst–Planck model with ionic steric effects (SPNP). Positivity preserving schemes based on harmonic-mean approximations are proposed on a nonuniform mesh for the spatial discretization of the SPNP equations. Both explicit and semi-implicit discretization are considered in time. Numerical analysis shows that explicit forward Euler and semi-implicit trapezoidal discretization lead to schemes that maintain fully discrete solution positivity under a constraint on a mesh ratio, while the semi-implicit backward Euler discretization maintain fully discrete solution positivity unconditionally. We further study the condition numbers of the matrix associated with the semi-implicit backward Euler discretization, and establish an upper bound on condition numbers, indicating that the developed discretization based on harmonic-mean approximations effectively solves the issue of the presence of large condition numbers when using the Slotboom-type variables. Further numerical simulations confirm the analysis results on accuracy, positivity, and bounded condition numbers. The proposed schemes are also applied to study practical applications, such as the impact of self and cross steric interactions on ion distribution and rectifying behavior in a slit-shaped nanopore with surface charges. Possible extensions of the numerical methods to other modified PNP models with ion correlations and steric effects are also discussed.},

  abstract = {From molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry, to plasma physics and computational astrophysics, Poisson solvers in the unit cube are used in many applications in computational science and engineering. In this work, we benchmark and discuss the performance of the scalable methods for the Poisson problem which are used widely in practice: the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the fast multipole method (FMM), the geometric multigrid (GMG), and algebraic multigrid (AMG). Our focus is on solvers supporting high-order, highly nonuniform discretizations. To allow comparisons with standard libraries we also compare adaptive solvers with solvers specialized for problems on regular grids, that is, FFT and regular-stencil multigrid, since both are very popular algorithms for several practical applications. For the multigrid, we use the finite element variant of a high-performance geometric multigrid (HPGMG) benchmark. In total we compare five different codes, three of which are developed in our group. Our FFT, GMG, and FMM are parallel solvers that use high-order approximation schemes for Poisson problems with continuous forcing functions (the source or right-hand side). Our FFT code is based on the FFTW for single node parallelism. The AMG code is from the Trilinos library from the Sandia National Laboratory. Our GMG and FMM support octree based mesh refinement and variable coefficients and enable highly nonuniform discretizations. The GMG actually also supports complex (noncubic) geometries using a forest of octrees. We examine and report results for weak scaling, strong scaling, and time to solution for uniform and highly refined grids. We present results on the Stampede system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and on the Titan system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In our largest test case, we solved a problem with 600 billion unknowns on 229,379 cores of Titan. Overall, all methods scale quite well to these problem sizes. We have tested all of the methods with different source functions (the right-hand side in the Poisson problem). Our results indicate that FFT is the method of choice for smooth source functions that require uniform resolution. However, FFT loses its performance advantage when the source function has highly localized features like internal sharp layers. FMM and GMG considerably outperform FFT for those cases. The distinction between FMM and GMG is less pronounced and is sensitive to the quality (from a performance point of view) of the underlying implementations. The high-order accurate versions of GMG and FMM significantly outperform their low-order accurate counterparts.},

  abstract = {We propose in this paper two kinds of continuity preserving discrete shape gradients of boundary type for PDE-constrained shape optimizations. First, a modified boundary shape gradient formula for shape optimization problems governed by elliptic Dirichlet problems was proposed recently based on the discrete variational outward normal derivatives. The advantages of this new formula over the previous one lie in the improved numerical accuracy and the continuity along the boundary. In the current paper we generalize this new formula to other shape optimization problems including the Laplace and Stokes eigenvalue optimization problems, the shape optimization of Stokes or Navier--Stokes flows, and the interface identification problems. We verify this new formula's numerical accuracy in different shape optimization problems and investigate its performance in several popular shape optimization algorithms. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a continuous discrete shape gradients of boundary type for Neumann problems, by using the ideas of gradient recovery techniques. The continuity property of the discrete boundary shape gradient is helpful in certain shape optimization algorithms and provides certain flexibility compared to the previous discontinuous ones, which are extensively discussed in the current paper.},

We approximate the solution by the neural networks and, since the solution may change dramatically across the interface, we employ different neural networks for each sub-domain. By reformulating the interface problem as a least-squares problem, we discretize the objective function using mean squared error via sampling and solve the proposed deep least-squares method by standard training algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent. The discretized objective function utilizes only the point-wise information on the sampling points and thus no underlying mesh is required. Doing this circumvents the challenging meshing procedure as well as the numerical integration on the complex interfaces. To improve the computational efficiency for more challenging problems, we further design an adaptive sampling strategy based on the residual of the least-squares function and propose an adaptive algorithm. Finally, we present several numerical experiments in both 2D and 3D to show the flexibility, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed deep least-square method for solving interface problems.},

abstract = {A new 2nd order accurate numerical method on non-body-fitting grids is proposed for solving the variable coefficient elliptic equation in disjoint subdomains Ω± separated by interfaces Γ. The variable coefficients, the source term, and hence the solution itself and its derivatives may be discontinuous across the interfaces. Jump conditions in solution and its co-normal derivative at interface are prescribed. Instead of smooth, the interfaces are only required to be Lipschitz continuous as submanifold. A weak formulation is developed, the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solutions are studied. The numerical method is derived by discretizing the weak formulation. The method is different from traditional finite element methods. Extensive numerical experiments are presented and show that the method is 2nd order accurate in solution and 1st order accurate in its gradient in L∞ norm if the interface is C2 and solutions are C2 on the closures of the subdomains. The method can handle the problems when the solutions and/or the interfaces are weaker than C2. For example, u∈H2(Ω±), Γ is Lipschitz continuous and their singularities coincide, see Example 18 in Section 4. The accuracies of the method under various circumstances are listed in Table 19.}

  abstract = {In this paper, a new Discontinuity Capturing Shallow Neural Network (DCSNN) for approximating d-dimensional piecewise continuous functions and for solving elliptic interface problems is developed. There are three novel features in the present network; namely, (i) jump discontinuities are accurately captured, (ii) it is completely shallow, comprising only one hidden layer, (iii) it is completely mesh-free for solving partial differential equations. The crucial idea here is that a d-dimensional piecewise continuous function can be extended to a continuous function defined in (d+1)-dimensional space, where the augmented coordinate variable labels the pieces of each sub-domain. We then construct a shallow neural network to express this new function. Since only one hidden layer is employed, the number of training parameters (weights and biases) scales linearly with the dimension and the neurons used in the hidden layer. For solving elliptic interface problems, the network is trained by minimizing the mean square error loss that consists of the residual of the governing equation, boundary condition, and the interface jump conditions. We perform a series of numerical tests to demonstrate the accuracy of the present network. Our DCSNN model is efficient due to only a moderate number of parameters needed to be trained (a few hundred parameters used throughout all numerical examples), and the results indicate good accuracy. Compared with the results obtained by the traditional grid-based immersed interface method (IIM), which is designed particularly for elliptic interface problems, our network model shows a better accuracy than IIM. We conclude by solving a six-dimensional problem to demonstrate the capability of the present network for high-dimensional applications.},

Both the convergence rate of the UIPFE solution and the condition number of the algebraic system are optimal and independent of the interface position. Furthermore, the error estimates do not depend on the ratio of the discontinuous coefficients. Numerical examples are also given to confirm the theoretical results.}

The expressions of the parameters of the new formulae are written in a way which makes them tuned also for functions of form y(x) = f1(x) sinh(λx) + f2(x) cosh(λx).

  abstract = {This work presents a fast Cartesian grid-based integral equation method for unbounded interface problems with non-homogeneous source terms. The unbounded interface problem is solved with boundary integral equation methods such that infinite boundary conditions are satisfied naturally. This work overcomes two difficulties. The first difficulty is the evaluation of singular integrals. Boundary and volume integrals are transformed into equivalent but much simpler bounded interface problems on rectangular domains, which are solved with FFT-based finite difference solvers. The second one is the expensive computational cost for volume integrals. Despite the use of efficient interface problem solvers, the evaluation for volume integrals is still expensive due to the evaluation of boundary conditions for the simple interface problem. The problem is alleviated by introducing an auxiliary circle as a bridge to indirectly evaluate boundary conditions. Since solving boundary integral equations on a circular boundary is so accurate, one only needs to select a fixed number of points for the discretization of the circle to reduce the computational cost. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and the second-order accuracy of the proposed numerical method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the application of an HLLC-type approximate Riemann solver in conjunction with the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta method to the seven-equation compressible two-phase model on multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is presented. Based on the idea proposed by Abgrall et al. that “a multiphase flow, uniform in pressure and velocity at t=0, will remain uniform on the same variables during time evolution”, discretization schemes for the non-conservative terms and for the volume fraction evolution equation are derived in accordance with the HLLC solver used for the conservative terms. To attain high temporal accuracy, the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta method is implemented in conjunction with operator splitting technique, in which the sequence of operators is recorded in order to compute free surface problems robustly. For large scale simulations, the numerical method is implemented using MPI/Pthread-CUDA parallelization paradigm for multiple GPUs. Domain decomposition method is used to distribute data to different GPUs, parallel computation inside a GPU is accomplished using CUDA, and communication between GPUs is performed via MPI or Pthread. Efficient data structure and GPU memory usage are employed to maintain high memory bandwidth of the device, while a special procedure is designed to synchronize thread blocks so as to reduce frequencies of kernel launching. Numerical tests against several one- and two-dimensional compressible two-phase flow problems with high density and high pressure ratios demonstrate that the present method is accurate and robust. The timing tests show that the overall speedup of one NVIDIA Tesla C2075 GPU is 31× compared with one Intel Xeon Westmere 5675 CPU core, and nearly 70% parallel efficiency can be obtained when using 8 GPUs.},

  abstract = {The fast multipole method (FMM) has been regarded as one of the top 10 algorithms in scientific computing that were developed in the 20th century. Combined with the FMM, the boundary element method (BEM) can now solve large-scale problems with several million degrees of freedom on a desktop computer within hours. This opened up a wide range of applications for the BEM that has been hindered for many years by the lack of efficiencies in the solution process, although it has been regarded as superb in the modeling stage. However, understanding the fast multipole BEM is even more difficult as compared with the conventional BEM, because of the added complexities and different approaches in both FMM formulations and implementations. This paper is an introduction to the fast multipole BEM for potential problems, which is aimed to overcome this hurdle for people who are familiar with the conventional BEM and want to learn and adopt the fast multipole approach. The basic concept and main procedures in the FMM for solving boundary integral equations are described in detail using the 2D potential problem as an example. The structure of a fast multipole BEM program is presented and the source code is also made available that can help the development of fast multipole BEM codes for solving other problems. Numerical examples are presented to further demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and potentials of the fast multipole BEM for solving large-scale problems.},

  abstract  = {Operator splitting is a numerical method of computing the solution to a differential equation. The splitting method separates the original equation into two parts over a time step, separately computes the solution to each part, and then combines the two separate solutions to form a solution to the original equation. A canonical example is splitting of diffusion terms and convection terms in a convection-diffusion partial differential equation. Related applications of splitting for reaction-diffusion partial differential equations in chemistry and in biology are emphasized here. The splitting idea generalizes in a natural way to equations with more than two operators. In all cases, the computational advantage is that it is faster to compute the solution of the split terms separately, than to compute the solution directly when they are treated together. However, this comes at the cost of an error introduced by the splitting, so strategies have been devised to control this error. This chapter introduces splitting methods and surveys recent developments in the area. An interesting perspective on absorbing boundary conditions in wave equations comes via Toeplitz-plus-Hankel splitting. One recent development, balanced splitting, deserves and receives special mention: it is a new splitting method that correctly captures steady state behavior.},

  abstract =       {The water hammer phenomenon is the main problem in long-distance pipeline networks. The MOC (Method of characteristics) and finite difference methods lead to severe constraints on the mesh and Courant number, while the finite volume method of the second-order Godunov scheme has limited intermittent capture capability. These methods will produce severe numerical dissipation, affecting the computational efficiency at low Courant numbers. Based on the lax-Friedrichs flux splitting method, combined with the upstream and downstream virtual grid boundary conditions, this paper uses the high-precision fifth-order WENO scheme to reconstruct the interface flux and establishes a finite volume numerical model for solving the transient flow in the pipeline. The model adopts the GPU parallel acceleration technology to improve the program&rsquo;s computational efficiency. The results show that the model maintains the excellent performance of intermittent excitation capture without spurious oscillations even at a low Courant number. Simultaneously, the model has a high degree of flexibility in meshing due to the high insensitivity to the Courant number. The number of grids in the model can be significantly reduced and higher computational efficiency can be obtained compared with MOC and the second-order Godunov scheme. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the acceleration effect in different grids. Accordingly, the acceleration effect of the GPU technique increases significantly with the increase in the number of computational grids. This model can support efficient and accurate fast simulation and prediction of non-constant transient processes in long-distance water pipeline systems.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider numerical methods for the Poisson–Nernst–Planck–Cahn–Hilliard (PNPCH) equations with steric interactions, which correspond to a non-constant mobility H−1 gradient flow of a free-energy functional that consists of electrostatic free energies, steric interaction energies of short range, entropic contribution of ions, and concentration gradient energies. We propose a novel energy stable numerical scheme that respects mass conservation and positivity at the discrete level. Existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed nonlinear scheme are established by showing that the solution is a unique minimizer of a convex functional over a closed, convex domain. The positivity of numerical solutions is further theoretically justified by the singularity of the entropy terms, which prevents the minimizer from approaching zero concentrations. A further numerical analysis proves discrete free-energy dissipation. Extensive numerical tests are performed to validate that the numerical scheme is first-order accurate in time and second-order accurate in space, and is capable of preserving the desired properties, such as mass conservation, positivity, and free energy dissipation, at the discrete level. Moreover, the PNPCH equations and the proposed scheme are applied to study charge dynamics and self-assembled nanopatterns in highly concentrated electrolytes that are widely used in electrochemical energy devices. Numerical results demonstrate that the PNPCH equations and our numerical scheme are able to capture nanostructures, such as lamellar patterns and labyrinthine patterns in electric double layers and the bulk, and multiple time relaxation with multiple time scales. The multiple time relaxation dynamics with metastability take long time to reach an equilibrium, highlighting the need for robust, energy stable numerical schemes that allow large time stepping. In addition, we numerically characterize the interplay between cross steric interactions of short range and the concentration gradient regularization, and their impact on the development of nanostructures in the equilibrium state.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

The solution of this augmented system can become quite challenging or even impossible due to the increased computational resources and effort required, especially in large-scale problems with large parameter variability. Recent developments in computer hardware regarding graphics processing units (GPU)-accelerated computing have been proven very promising due to their advanced capabilities and have been used in a number of scientific fields in order to enhance the solution of computationally high demanding problems. In this work, the benefits achieved with the exploitation of the GPU capabilities are demonstrated, in addressing intrusive stochastic mechanics problems where the solution of the resulting finite element algebraic equations is performed with the dual domain decomposition method, implementing specifically tailored preconditioners. The results show a significant enhancement of the spectral stochastic finite element method in terms of computational performance as well as of the consumed energy efficiency when applying the proposed methodology.},

We first present a DG discretization with a dual-consistent output evaluation for elliptic interface problems on interface-conforming meshes, and then extend the method to handle multi-physics interface problems, in particular conjugate heat transfer (CHT) problems. The method is then applied to non-interface-conforming meshes using a cut-cell technique, where the interface definition is completely separate from the mesh generation process. No assumption is made on the interface shape (other than Lipschitz continuity). We then equip our strategy with an output-based adaptive scheme for an accurate output prediction. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate high-order convergence for elliptic interface problems and CHT problems with both smooth and non-smooth interface shapes.},

However, an adequate description of these extensions would require another long section and it was felt that the principles involved in making parabolic approximations have been sufficiently illustrated.

abstract = {We present a new fast multipole method for particle simulations. The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels.}

We use Nyström’s method for discretization, and combine it with special quadrature rules for the singular kernels that appear in the boundary integrals. The overall asymptotic complexity of our method is O(N3/2), where N is the number of discretization points on the boundary of the domain, and corresponds to linear complexity in the number of uniformly sampled evaluation points. A kernel-independent fast summation algorithm is used to accelerate the evaluation of the discretized integral operators. We describe a high-order accurate method for evaluating the solution at arbitrary points inside the domain, including points close to the domain boundary. We demonstrate how our solver, combined with a regular-grid spectral solver, can be applied to problems with distributed sources. We present numerical results for the Stokes, Navier, and Poisson problems.}

It solves equations in the framework of boundary integral equations, whose corresponding discrete forms are well-conditioned and solved by the GMRES method. A notable feature of this approach is that the boundary or volume integrals encountered in BIEs are indirectly evaluated by a Cartesian grid-based method, which includes discretizing corresponding simple interface problems with a MAC scheme, correcting discrete linear systems to reduce large local truncation errors near the interface, solving the modified system by a CG method together with an FFT-based Poisson solver. No extra work or special quadratures are required to deal with singular or hyper-singular boundary integrals and the dependence on the analytical expressions of Green’s functions for the integral kernels is completely eliminated. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Cartesian grid-based method.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel high order interface scheme, the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method, for solving elliptic equations with discontinuous coefficients and singular sources on Cartesian grids. By appropriate use of auxiliary line and/or fictitious points, physical jump conditions are enforced at the interface. Unlike other existing interface schemes, the proposed method disassociates the enforcement of physical jump conditions from the discretization of the differential equation under study. To construct higher order interface schemes, the proposed MIB method bypasses the major challenge of implementing high order jump conditions by repeatedly enforcing the lowest order jump conditions. The proposed MIB method is of arbitrarily high order, in principle. In treating straight, regular interfaces we construct MIB schemes up to 16th-order. For more general elliptic problems with curved, irregular interfaces and boundary, up to 6th-order MIB schemes have been demonstrated. By employing the standard high-order finite difference schemes to discretize the Laplacian, the present MIB method automatically reduces to the standard central difference scheme when the interface is absent. The immersed interface method (IIM) is regenerated for a comparison study of the proposed method. The robustness of the MIB method is verified against the large magnitude of the jump discontinuity across the interface. The nature of high efficiency and low memory requirement of the MIB method is extensively validated via solving various elliptic immersed interface problems in two- and three-dimensions.},

  abstract  = {A GPU cluster is a cluster equipped with GPU devices. Excellent acceleration is achievable for computation-intensive tasks (e. g. matrix multiplication and LINPACK) and bandwidth-intensive tasks with data locality (e. g. finite-difference simulation). Bandwidth-intensive tasks such as large-scale FFTs without data locality are harder to accelerate, as the bottleneck often lies with the PCI between main memory and GPU device memory or the communication network between workstation nodes. That means optimizing the performance of FFT for a single GPU device will not improve the overall performance. This paper uses large-scale FFT as an example to show how to achieve substantial speedups for these more challenging tasks on a GPU cluster. Three GPU-related factors lead to better performance: firstly the use of GPU devices improves the sustained memory bandwidth for processing large-size data; secondly GPU device memory allows larger subtasks to be processed in whole and hence reduces repeated data transfers between memory and processors; and finally some costly main-memory operations such as matrix transposition can be significantly sped up by GPUs if necessary data adjustment is performed during data transfers. This technique of manipulating array dimensions during data transfer is the main technical contribution of this paper. These factors (as well as the improved communication library in our implementation) attribute to 24.3x speedup with respect to FFTW and 7x speedup with respect to Intel MKL for 4096 3D single-precision FFT on a 16-node cluster with 32 GPUs. Around 5x speedup with respect to both standard libraries are achieved for double precision.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of different methods to calculate the classical electrostatic Hartree potential created by charge distributions. Our goal is to provide the reader with an estimation on the performance—in terms of both numerical complexity and accuracy—of popular Poisson solvers, and to give an intuitive idea on the way these solvers operate. Highly parallelizable routines have been implemented in a first-principle simulation code (Octopus) to be used in our tests, so that reliable conclusions about the capability of methods to tackle large systems in cluster computing can be obtained from our work. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

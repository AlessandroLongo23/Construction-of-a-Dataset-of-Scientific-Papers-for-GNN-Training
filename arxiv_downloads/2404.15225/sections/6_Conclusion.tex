\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes PHLP, an explainable method that applies PH to analyze the topological structure of graphs to overcome the limitations of GNN-based methods for LP.
By employing the proposed methods, such as angle hop subgraphs and Degree DRNL, PHLP improves the analysis of the topological structure of graphs.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PHLP method achieves competitive performance across benchmark datasets, even SOTA performance, especially on the Power dataset. 
Additionally, when integrated with existing GNN-based methods, PHLP improves performance across all datasets.
By analyzing the topological information of the given graphs, PHLP addresses the limitations of GNN-based methods and enhances overall performance. 
As demonstrated, PHLP provides explainable algorithms without relying on complex deep learning techniques, providing insight into the factors that significantly influence performance for the LP problem of graph data.

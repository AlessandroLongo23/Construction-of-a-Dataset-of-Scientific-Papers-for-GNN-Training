Since traditional communication infrastructures are often vulnerable to damage or complete collapse during such events, the use of uncrewed aerial vehicles~(UAVs), as nonterrestrial networks~(NTN) element, emerges as a promising solution to meet communication needs. This is achieved by deploying base stations~(BSs) on UAVs, which are referred to as UAVBSs. UAVs can be regarded as an ideal choice for SAR missions, disaster management, and emergency response operations due to their speed, flexibility, and mobility, and they can be easily deployed and positioned anywhere, even in hardtoreach areas, providing communication connectivity.",

In particular, a threelayer network is proposed, wherein the user equipments~(UEs) are on the first layer (i.e., ground), UAVBSs are on the second layer (i.e., 100200 meters above the ground) providing radio access network~(RAN) services, and HAPSSMBS is on the third layer (i.e., around 20 km from the ground) providing backhaul services to the UAVBSs. In addition, a twolayer clustering algorithm is proposed, such that UEs, who gather in hotspots, form clusters on the first layer, and the UAVBSs on the second layer are positioned according to the results of this clustering. Then, a further clustering operation is also performed on the UAVBSs for the backhaul link. More specifically, the cluster head UAV, referred to as HUAV, collects data from other UAVs in the form of adhoc networking and transmit to HAPSSMBS. In other words, only HUAVpositioned at a predesignated location that has a grid power connection as well as uninterrupted power supplyhas a backhaul link to prolong the network lifespan, because the energy consumption of nonhead UAVs~(referred to as NHUAVs) for the backhaul connection is eliminated in our proposed topology.",

Unlike the firstlayer clustering, this time the twodimensional coordinates of the UAVBSs (obtained in the firstlayer clustering) are fed into another kmeans algorithm to compute the centroid positions. After that, the UAVBS that has the closest proximity to the centroid is assigned as HUAV, and the rest of the UAVBSs serve as NHUAVs. The UAVBSs then form an adhoc network in such a way that the NHUAVs are transferring their data to the HUAV, which has the capability of connecting to HAPSSMBS via a backhauling link. As mentioned earlier, some landing spots, with grid and generator power supplies as well as a clear lineofsight with the majority of the area that they are planned to serve, are deployed around the city. Therefore, the HUAV is positioned at the nearest landing spot for continuous energy supply to prevent its battery from depleting fast as it is responsible to transmit all the data of the affected region. The effects of the distance between the landing spots and optimal position of UAVBSs on the energy efficiency are deeply investigated in, which can be used as a complementary source to this present work.",

As expected, the energy score soars with δ for each method as λ rises with increasing δ, which in turn boosts the total energy score as given in~ and . While SLC and CUP show similar behaviors, DLCAHN is separated from them with a considerably lower energy score. The reason for this is that the NHUAVs do not have backhauling link to HAPSSMB and they only transmit their data to HUAV, which is in a much closer proximity to them compared to HAPSSMBS. For SLC and CUP, on the other hand, all the UAVBSs need to transmit their data to HAPSSMBS, and considering, their energy scores soar significantly. SLC and CUP appear almost on top of each other in Fig.~, but there is a difference of 0.41% between them in terms of the total energy score. In SLC, since UAVBSs are positioned at the centroid point determined as a result of the clustering, the distance is minimized and they consume less energy than CUP.",

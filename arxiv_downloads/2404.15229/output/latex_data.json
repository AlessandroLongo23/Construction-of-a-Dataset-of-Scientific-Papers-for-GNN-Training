Deploying uncrewed aerial vehicle base stations (UAVBSs) can provide a radio access network (RAN); however, the backhaul link may also be damaged and unserviceable in such disaster conditions. In this regard, highaltitude platform stations (HAPS) spark attention as they can be deployed as super macro base stations (SMBS) and data centers. Therefore, in this study, we investigate a threelayer heterogeneous network with different topologies to prolong the lifespan of the temporary network by using UAVBSs for RAN services and HAPSSMBS as a backhaul. Furthermore, a twolayer clustering algorithm is proposed to handle the UAVBS adhoc networking effectively.",
